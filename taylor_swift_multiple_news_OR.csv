Taylor Swift and actor Joe Alwyn have broken up after six years together.
A source close to Taylor confirmed the news to CNN saying “Taylor and Joe broke up a few weeks ago. They simply grew apart and plan to remain friends.”
CNN has reached out to Swift and Alwyn’s reps for comment. Entertainment Tonight was first to report the news.
Swift, who is currently on her “Eras Tour,” and Alwyn were first linked romantically in 2016.
The Grammy-winner and Alwyn managed to keep their relationship mostly under wraps, but in true Taylor Swift style, the singer dropped some Easter eggs about Alwyn through her music along the way.
In January, Swift revealed on her Instagram that “Lavender Haze,” a track from her 2022 album “Midnights,” is about Alwyn, saying when you’re in a lavender haze of love, “you’ll do anything to stay there and not let people bring you down off of that cloud.”
“Like my relationship for six years, we’ve had to dodge weird rumors, tabloid stuff and we just ignore it. This song is sort of about the act of ignoring that stuff to protect the real stuff,” she added.

Alwyn also earned a writing credit on “Midnights” for the song “Sweet Nothing.”
It’s not the first time the couple have collaborated on songs that have appeared on Swift’s albums. The British actor was credited on a number of songs from Swift’s 2020 pandemic-era albums “folklore” and “evermore” under the pseudonym “William Bowery.”
Swift confirmed the true identity on the Disney+ documentary “folklore: the long pond studio sessions” that same year, where she said Alwyn “plays piano beautifully and he’s always just playing and making things up and kind of creating things.”
“Folklore” ended up winning a Grammy for album of the year in 2021, marking Alwyn’s first Grammy win.
There was also speculation in 2019 the then-couple were engaged when Swifties picked up on some bridal-leaning lyrics in “Lover,” the title track off the album she released that year.
“If I had a pound for every time I think I’ve been told I’ve been engaged, then I’d have a lot of pound coins,” Alwyn told WSJ Magazine in 2022, coyly adding “I mean, the truth is, if the answer was yes, I wouldn’t say, and if the answer was no, I wouldn’t say.”",2023-04-09 17:19:35

Taylor Swift is known for dropping Easter eggs in her work and sharing about her relationships in her music.
Some of her fans believe she has done both regarding her breakup after six years with actor Joe Alwyn.
The superstar singer reportedly swapped out her hopeful love song “Invisible String” for “The 1,” which talks about someone who was looking for “the one,” in her Eras Tour playlist. The change has not gone unnoticed on social media.
“In her last show she replaced invisible string with the one… this is real #taylorswift #joealwyn,” one person tweeted on April 8.
According to People, Swift made the change late last month during her concert at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas.
Both songs appear on her Grammy winning “Folklore” album. Alwyn contributed to the project using the pseudonym “William Bowery.”
The lyrics to “Invisible String” reference finding love after heartache.
“Time, mystical time/Cuttin’ me open, then healin’ me fine/Were there clues I didn’t see?” the lyrics read. “Isn’t it just so pretty to think/All along there was some/Invisible string/Tying you to me?”
“The 1” is a song about a love that didn’t work out.
“But we were something, don’t you think so?/Roaring 20s, tossing pennies in the pool/And if my wishes came true/It would’ve been you,” Swift sings. “In my defense, I have none/For never leaving well enough alone/But it would’ve been fun/If you would’ve been the one.”

Fans of Ms. Swift spent much of the weekend grappling with the possibility that the “Midnights” singer and her longtime boyfriend, the British actor Joe Alwyn, had broken up, after reports from “Entertainment Tonight” and People magazine said the couple was through.
“ET” was vague about how it had come by the information, saying in its story on Friday afternoon only that it had “learned” that Ms. Swift and Mr. Alwyn had split. A few hours later, People matched the report with a story of its own citing an unnamed person close to the pair as its source. Both outlets said the breakup had occurred weeks ago.
With no comment from Ms. Swift, Mr. Alwyn or their representatives, fans of the singer were not sure whether to trust what they had read. Ms. Swift’s publicist, Tree Paine, did not immediately respond to requests for comment for this article.",2023-04-10 20:17:48

Tree has been head of Taylor's publicity team since 2014
Taylor Swift's publicist has hit out at rumours that the popstar secretly married ex-partner Joe Alwyn.
Tree Paine accused anonymous celebrity gossip account, Deuxmoi, of causing ""pain and trauma"" after it made the claims.
In an Instagram Story, Deuxmoi said the Cruel Summer hitmaker married Joe in 2020 or 2021 in a non-legal ceremony.
""Enough is enough with these fabricated lies about Taylor from Deuxmoi,"" Tree wrote on X/Twitter.
""There was NEVER a marriage or ceremony of ANY kind.""
News of Taylor and Joe splitting made headlines in May 2023, with the Shake It Off star since being linked with NFL player Travis Kelce.
Deuxmoi later responded to Tree's post, writing that they ""make zero dollars from lying"", then querying ""can publicists say the same"".
""Either way, I apologise to Taylor,"" the post ended.

News of Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn's split hit headlines earlier this year
Tree has led Taylor's publicity team since 2014, and has often been seen at events with Taylor, such as the London premiere of Beyoncé's Renaissance tour film.
The 12-time Grammy award winner previously told a fan that Tree ""tells me what to do"".
Taylor has just released You're Losing Me on streaming services, which many fans think is about the decline of her and Joe's relationship.
But Jack Antonoff, Taylor's collaborator, said the song was recorded on 5 December 2021 - before Joe and Taylor split.
What is Deuxmoi?
The account has over two million followers on Instagram and claims to be a ""curator of pop culture"".
It's known for posting anonymous messages from unverified sources about celebrities - covering everything from relationship news to music, film and product releases.
""Some statements made on this account have not been independently confirmed,"" Deuxmoi's Instagram bio reads.
""This account does not claim information published is based in fact.""
It also posts pictures of celebrities submitted by followers, which fans have snapped when they're out and about.
The owner of the account prefers to stay anonymous, though MailOnline claimed it was a woman behind the account in 2022.
Speaking to the site, Deuxmoi said she wasn't an ""investigative journalist"".",2023-12-01 11:14:18

Every year seems to be Taylor Swift’s year.
Since the early stages of her career, Swift has consistently held the news cycle in the palm of her hands — making headlines for everything from her romantic interests to the sale of her masters and the resulting rereleases.
And yet 2023 feels like it was her biggest year yet. With a record-breaking world tour, an accompanying concert film, and a high-profile, gush-worthy relationship with one of the best players in the NFL, Swift is winning the year in a way most people could only dream.
To top it all off, she was named Time magazine’s “Person of the Year” — a title reserved for cultural changemakers like former President Barack Obama (2008 and 2012), persecuted journalists like Jamal Khashoggi, murdered for disagreeing with the Saudi government (2018), and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (2022). Swift’s gravitational pull is so strong, it rivals that of world leaders.
In honor of one of Swift’s best years yet, here’s a look at all the things she made us care about this year.
The Kansas City Chiefs’ offense

When Swift started dating Chiefs’ tight end Travis Kelce, arguably one of the greatest players at his position, the internet seemingly imploded. Fresh off a break-up with actor Joe Alwyn, Swift’s new fling with Kelce quickly became delightful fan fodder, as Swifties dug up Kelce’s old posts on X, formerly known as Twitter, and analyzed their every movement.
Swift’s presence at Chiefs games also became an ongoing “Where’s Waldo?” as the star was frequently photographed cheering on her new boo alongside people like gymnast Simone Biles and Kelce’s mother Donna.
Her starpower was so intense that it brought a 400% spike in sales of Kelce jerseys and drove up prices of Chiefs’ tickets, as Swifties ran to the games in hopes of catching a glimpse. During broadcasts, Swift and her devotees became a regular part of NFL commentators’ discourse, to the chagrin of some NFL fans.
Not much can overshadow football in the US, but this year, Swift managed just that.
‘Seemingly Ranch’

Every detail of Swift’s presence at Chiefs’ games was scrutinized, including what she ate. In one instance, according to a fan account, her meal consisted of chicken tenders, ketchup and “seemingly ranch.”
The phrasing quickly became a meme, so much so that Heinz developed a limited edition “Ketchup and Seemingly Ranch” sauce, a wink to fans and also, frankly, a marketing ploy.
Having so much power that your preferred chicken tender accompaniments become adopted by a national brand? That’s just a regular Sunday for Swift.
Public transportation

Swift’s sold-out Eras Tour had fans relying on buses, subways and trains (oh my!) to travel to venues — revitalizing many cities’ public transportation system in the process.
In Chicago, the CTA provided 5.63 million rides the week of June 4 to 10, the highest number since the start of the pandemic. The CTA attributed the spike to Swift’s sold-out show that week. In Atlanta, almost 140,000 people swarmed the city’s Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority system, more than three times the number of riders during a usual weekend, CNN previously reported. Philadelphia and New Jersey had similar boosts.
Hotels and restaurants benefited, too, and Swift’s tour led to a boost in local economies across the country — a huge win for many as some continue to fear an oncoming recession. As the Wall Street Journal said, “It’s simple Taylornomics.”
Trendy Manhattan restaurants

Swift going out to eat may not seem significant to some. But, as Rachel Handler detailed in Vulture, Swift is not a regular celebrity, nor is she a regular middle class patron. And yet, for a period this past fall, Swift was regularly photographed going out to some of the trendiest Manhattan restaurants and bars, alongside a rotating star-studded group of friends.
Though one can’t say why Swift did this: Did she simply not have food at home? Did she want to grab a drink with the girls? Was her private chef on vacation? No matter the motivation, it did cause a brief stir in the Manhattan dining scene. Handler retraced Swift’s steps across the city, asking Emilio of Emilio’s Ballato what it’s like when Swift eats at your restaurant. His response was simple: “What can I tell you? She eats, she pays, she gets the f**k out.” Celebrities, they’re just like us.
The details of film distribution

Shot over three nights during her residency at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles in August, Swift’s “Eras” concert film broke records in its opening weekend. It raked in $96 million, making it the highest-grossing concert film domestically for an opening weekend, according to AMC.
But that’s not the only way Swift changed the game with her concert film. Swift produced the film herself and distributed the movie directly through AMC Theatres, instead of through a traditional Hollywood distributor. As a result, she cut out the usual big Hollywood studio middleman and was able to secure a much higher payday for herself and her team.
The route is definitely an unconventional one, and it could be a tactic employed by other big stars. Beyoncé made a similar move for her own Renaissance tour film, and though few have the starpower of Queen Bey and Swift, the trend may be one worth monitoring.
Summer camp core

In “You’re on Your Own, Kid,” Swift beckons listeners to “make the friendship bracelets” rather than yearning for love. The line is only said once, but once was enough: Friendship bracelets, suddenly, were everywhere, even though the track was released last year.
Swifties raided their local craft stores to carefully string together friendship bracelets as part of their Eras Tour look — making the bracelets a tour staple. Even celebrities sported the trend. Nicole Kidman received some bracelets while at Swift’s show, as did Jennifer Lawrence and, of course, Swift herself.
Even her security guard was not immune to the throwback mementos. If you see them on runways next year, don’t be surprised.
Monopolies and Ticketmaster

At the end of last year Live Nation, Ticketmaster’s parent company, faced heavy criticism for its botched handling of presales for Swift’s then-upcoming Eras Tour, which left millions of fans unable to both buy tickets or without tickets, despite purchasing.
Although Ticketmaster and Live Nation have long been scrutinized for having a monopoly power over ticket sales, the incident was a major catalyst in Congress looking into the company. Lawmakers grilled the CFO of Live Nation in January, and a Senate subcommittee issued a subpoena to the company just last month, requiring documents related to its “ticket pricing, fees, and resale practices.”
Getting the US government to kick into high gear after a company mishandles ticket sales to your upcoming tour is not a power many artists wield. No matter what happens, you’ll at least in part have Swift to thank.",2023-12-24 12:00:26

“It was my favorite,” Swift continued. “It was about something very personal to me. It was very hard to perform it live. Now for me, honestly, this song is 100 percent about us and for you.”
Several people were already in tears — having burst into heaving, Beatlemania-style sobs as soon as Swift appeared in a regal purple pantsuit — but at this admission they cried audibly harder. “My actual mother!” one young woman gasped. Another, seated directly and perhaps precariously behind me, muttered repeatedly, “I’m going to throw up.”
Few A-list musicians of this millennium have sustained a bond with their fans as intensely as Swift with her “Swifties.” To her credit, she feeds them well. She drops Easter eggs like a benevolent mother hen, arranges elaborate meet-and-greets, and once invited some fans over to her house to listen to her new album while munching on cookies she’d baked for them.",2021-11-15 18:30:04
https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/09/entertainment/taylor-swift-13-travis-kelce/index.html,Taylor Swift’s favorite number is 13. That may bode well for Travis Kelce,"As even a casual fan of Taylor Swift can tell you, the singer’s favorite number is 13.","CNN —
As even a casual fan of Taylor Swift can tell you, the singer’s favorite number is 13.
“I was born on the 13th. I turned 13 on Friday the 13th. My first album went gold in 13 weeks. My first No. 1 song had a 13-second intro,” Swift told Jay Leno back in 2009. “Every time I’ve won an award I’ve been seated in either the 13th seat, the 13th row, the 13th section or row M, which is the 13th letter. Basically, whenever a 13 comes up in my life, it’s a good thing.”
Swift has had a lot of good things come up for her this past year. By all appearances, that includes the recent AFC Championship, where a certain couple looked like jovial lovebirds in a sports-adjacent romcom. The cinematic moment seemed to encapsulate Swift’s relationship thus far with Kansas City tight end Travis Kelce, whose number is 87. (No one’s perfect.)
This weekend, Kelce will battle with his team for the W against the San Francisco 49ers. Though Swift has an intimidating flight back to the US from Japan ahead of her in order to make the game, if she makes it (she will, the embassy claims), this game will be her 13th in attendance in support of Kelce.
If Swift’s lucky streak stays intact, the girl on the bleachers might find herself celebrating on the field again.
But it’s important to remember that Swift’s road to finding love has been a long game. Discounting a few outings with singer Matty Healy, Kelce appears to be the 13th guy Swift has dated under a public spotlight. A positive coincidence, likely, and no need to try and force the math when things seem to be adding up for the two.
We all kiss some frogs before meeting our Mr. Right, and it’s humanizing to know that even billionaire bosses aren’t exempt from the rules of love. Here’s a look back at Swift’s path to the friends and family suite at the Super Bowl.
Drew Dunlap and Sam Armstrong
These two were reportedly Swift’s high school boyfriends in the early 2000s.
Dunlap has long been believed to be the inspiration for her song “Tim McGraw,” in which she sings, “When you think Tim McGraw/I hope you think my favorite song/The one we danced to all night long.” The pair reportedly split when the older Dunlap went off to college.
The Armstrong relationship was reportedly a bit messier. Some went as far as to call their youthful relationship the root of “all of Taylor Swift’s angst.” She’s never spoken about it.
Joe Jonas

Another person who ran afoul of the Swifties is Joe Jonas.
The Jonas Brothers singer famously dated Swift back in 2008. Things didn’t work out for the pair, and when Swift appeared on the “Ellen DeGeneres Show” in 2008 following the couple’s split, she didn’t hold back when asked about Jonas.
“When I look at that person, I’m not even going to remember the boy who broke up with me over the phone in 25 seconds when I was 18,” Swift told host Ellen DeGeneres after saying she will find the right guy eventually, and that she wrote the breakup song “Forever & Always” about Jonas.
But all’s (too) well that ends well, hopefully. In May of last year, Jonas said during an appearance on the “Armchair Expert” podcast that he and Swift are “cool” now, and that he hopes her fans still like him.
Lucas Till

The “Hannah Montana: The Movie” star dated Swift for a few months after the pair met while filming the 2009 movie.
He told MTV that year, “We dated for a little bit. But, there was no friction because we were too nice.”
“We just really both liked each other … [but] most relationships work out cause you get along and then you don’t, and then you make up and its (sic) passionate, and with us I really just liked her as a friend,” he explained. “That’s the only reason that didn’t work out.”
Taylor Lautner

Then there was the tale of two Taylors.
Swift shared a sweet romance in 2009 with the “Twilight” star, who is believed to have inspired her bittersweet breakup tune “Back to December.”
Last year, Lautner revealed during an appearance on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast that Swift ended things, yet a beautiful friendship came from it.
“I think when you respect somebody for who they are, like in their soul, it allows you to move on, forgive and continue that love in a different way,” he said.
Lucky for him, Lautner is now married to a Swiftie who is named, wait for it, Taylor. She said on the podcast that Swift makes it “easy” for them to all be friends.
Lautner got his wife’s seal of approval to appear in the first music video from Swift’s “Speak Now (Taylor’s Version)” album, which she debuted at the first Eras Tour stop in Kansas City, Missouri last year.
Swift surprised the audience by bringing Lautner out on stage to debut the video.
John Mayer

That same year – 2009 – was also when Swift dated the music industry’s resident eligible bachelor and fellow artist John Mayer.
The general consensus is that one of her most brutal takedown-of-an-ex songs, “Dear John,” is about him. Last year Swift performed the song for the first time in years during an “Eras Tour” stop in Minneapolis. She implored people to be nice about it.
“I’m 33 years old. I don’t care about anything that happened to me when I was 19,” Swift told the audience at the time. “I’m not putting this album out so that you can go and should feel the need to defend me on the internet against someone you think I might have written a song about 14 billion years ago.”
Jake Gyllenhaal

Jake Gyllenhaal, meanwhile, does not believe he is the subject of Swift’s single “All Too Well.”
As she re-records her old music with “Taylor’s versions,” there as been new speculation about her inspirations – especially Gyllenhaal, who dated Swift off and on from 2010 to 2011.
In 2022, he told Esquire the tune was not about him.
“It has nothing to do with me,” he told the publication in a wide ranging interview. “It’s about her relationship with her fans.”
Tell that to Dionne Warwick.
In 2021, she had a message for Gyllenhaal after Swift released a short film for the single off her then-new “Red (Taylor’s Version)” album.
On the song’s lyric, “And I left my scarf there at your sister’s house / And you’ve still got it in your drawer even now,” Warwick posted on Twitter: “It does not belong to you. Box it up and I will pay the cost of postage, Jake.”
Conor Kennedy

Swift is pop music royalty, so it makes sense that she would eventually cross paths with America’s version of the royals.
She dated Robert and Ethel Kennedy’s grandson Conor Kennedy in the summer of 2012. The Swifties went wild when she purchased a home near the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.
But all summers come to an end.
Harry Styles

Some One Direction fans were unhappy about this relationship.
The pair were together from 2012 to 2013. In 2017, Styles told Rolling Stone he was aware that people believed her songs “Out of the Woods” and “Style” were inspired by their relationship.
He also talked about their romance.
“In writing songs about stuff like that, I like tipping a hat to the time together,” he said. “You’re celebrating the fact it was powerful and made you feel something, rather than ‘this didn’t work out, and that’s bad.’ And if you run into that person, maybe it’s awkward, maybe you have to get drunk … but you shared something.”
Calvin Harris

This one was a lot.
Swift and Harris seemed like a match made in musical heaven when they dated from 2015 to 2016.
Things went well – until they didn’t. When they split after 15 months, there was all types of drama, including the revelation that Swift had secretly written the song “This Is What You Came For,” under the pseudonym ”Nils Sjoberg.” The track, recorded by Harris and Rihanna, hit the top of the charts.
Harris talked to British GQ about the split.
“It’s very difficult when something I consider so personal plays out very publicly,” he said in the interview. “The aftermath of the relationship was way more heavily publicized than the relationship itself. When we were together, we were very careful for it not to be a media circus. She respected my feelings in that sense.”
Tom Hiddleston

Remember “Hiddleswift?”
This summer 2016 romance was highly publicized (because of course it was) and Harris even weighed in when he and Swift were feuding about her claiming songwriting credit on his hit (see above).
“I figure if you’re happy in your new relationship you should focus on that instead of trying to tear your ex bf down for something to do,” Harris wrote on Twitter at the time, referring to Swift’s relationship with Hiddleston.
Despite a PDA-filled summer, Swift and the “Loki” star split after a few months.

Swift soon switched from a very public relationship with an actor to an incredibly private one.
She met the British actor in 2016, but kept things so on the low that folks aren’t entirely sure when it turned romantic.
Both Swift and Alwyn made it a habit to not talk about each other for years.
And when they did, they didn’t say much.
“No, not at all. No. It’s flattering,” is all Alwyn said in an interview with The Times of London when asked if he was bothered about possibly inspiring Swift’s music.
Turns out not only was he an inspiration, but he also did some songwriting with his then-girlfriend.
“There’s been a lot of discussion about William Bowery and his identity, because it’s not a real person,” Swift said in the “folklore: the long pond studio sessions” documentary about her album. “So William Bowery is Joe, as we know. And Joe plays piano beautifully and he’s always just playing and making things up and kind of creating things.”
The pair split after six years together, with a source close to Taylor confirming the news to CNN in April 2023, saying “They simply grew apart and plan to remain friends.”",2024-02-10 00:24:38

Nick Cannon doesn’t love answering questions about his family and personal life and feels there’s a popular singer who can relate.
“The Masked Singer,” who is a father of 11 children, was recently asked by Howard Stern whether his family is complete.
“Every time I answer this question it I can never answer it correctly,” Cannon said, noting that once he angered some in the religious community by answering that he was “putting it in God’s hands.”
When Stern offered that it would have to be someone very special to have a child with Cannon and suggested Taylor Swift, Cannon was not opposed.
“I’m all in,” Cannon said, laughing. “First of all she’s an amazing songwriter. What I do love about Taylor Swift is that she has been so vulnerable and open with all of her music.”
Cannon joked that their respective relationships have faced similar public scrutiny.
“I think she would relate to me very well based off of like yo, you’ve dated a lot of people in the public eye, so have I,” he said. “We probably will really understand each other.”
Cannon said he was aware that Swift has split from longtime boyfriend, Joe Alwyn.
Swift is currently performing on her sold out 52-show “Eras Tour.”",2023-04-11 13:35:27

Swift announced her new album at the Grammy Awards on Sunday
US rapper Post Malone and British group Florence + The Machine will feature on Taylor Swift's new album, the singer has confirmed.
Swift announced the release of her new album during an acceptance speech at the Grammy Awards on Sunday.
The singer has now revealed the track list for the album, titled The Tortured Poets Department.
Meanwhile, fans are continuing to speculate about whether the singer will be able to attend Sunday's Super Bowl.
Set to be released on 19 April, Swift's new album will feature 16 tracks plus a bonus track.
Fans had already been speculating over whether the 34-year-old would announce new music during the ceremony, having previously made album announcements at other awards shows.
""I want to say thank you to the fans by telling you a secret I've been keeping from you for the last two years,"" Swift said after collecting the prize for best pop vocal album.

The track list reveals two collaborations - Post Malone on the first song of the album, Fortnight, and Florence + The Machine on Florida!!! It is the first time Swift has teamed up with either artist.
A song called So Long, London appears as the fifth track - the slot traditionally reserved by Swift for the most meaningful song on each of her albums.
Some fans have interpreted the title as a response or reference to her previous song London Boy, which was about spending time in the English capital with her former boyfriend Joe Alwyn.
There has also been speculation that tracks such as Down Bad, But Daddy I Love Him, I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can), and I Can Do It With A Broken Heart could also be inspired by their relationship.
The Tortured Poets Department is the singer's 11th album. It is her first album of entirely new material since October 2022's Midnights.

As part of her global sold-out Eras tour, Swift is set to perform in Tokyo on 10 February.
However, that is just one day before the Super Bowl, which takes place in Las Vegas on Sunday, where her boyfriend Travis Kelce is playing for the Kansas City Chiefs.
Swift has been seen supporting Kelce at several of his games, but fans have been speculating about whether it will be possible to attend the NFL championship.
The time difference between Tokyo and Las Vegas is 17 hours and a flight takes 12 hours.
However, earlier this month the Japanese embassy in Washington posted on X, formerly Twitter, reassuring fans that Swift ""should comfortably arrive before the Super Bowl begins"".

Swift's 'imperial phase'
By Mark Savage, BBC Music correspondent
Swift may have had a big night at the Grammys on Sunday, but the awards ceremony isn't solely about musical merit.
The singer is currently in the middle of an imperial phase. Her Eras tour has broken box office records, boosted local economies, prompted a government inquiry into Ticketmaster and even caused seismic activity.
The singer has also been named Time Magazine's person of the year, while her romance with Travis Kelce brought new eyes to American football.",2024-02-06 10:15:55

Taylor Swift has released a (very lavender) video for her song “Lavender Haze” off her new album.
Swift’s latest video debuted on Friday, just a day after she teased a new project to her followers on social media.
The trippy video, features Swift in a bedroom looking sad until she gets into a lavender haze, surrounded by flowers and a purple aura. She has shared that the song is about her relationship with boyfriend Joe Alwyn, and wanting to stay in a space that doesn’t let in the outside noise.
“I happened on the phrase ‘lavender haze’ when I was watching Mad Men, and I looked it up because I thought it sounded cool, and it turns out that it’s a common phrase used in the ’50s where they would just describe being in love,” she explained on social media when the song was released. “If you were in the lavender haze that meant you were in that all-encompassing love glow. I thought that was really beautiful.”

Swift continued: “I guess, theoretically, when you’re in the lavender haze you’ll do anything to stay there and not let people bring you down off of that cloud. I think a lot of people have to deal with this now, not just ‘public figures because we live in the era of social media, and if the world finds out that you’re in love with somebody they’re going to weigh in on it. Like my relationship for six years, we’ve had to dodge weird rumors, tabloid stuff and we just ignore it. This song is sort of about the act of ignoring that stuff to protect the real stuff.”
Swift also wrote and directed the video, as she did for other track videos off “Midnights,” like “Bejeweled” and “Anti-Hero.”",2023-01-27 17:13:29

According to Joe Alwyn, he didn’t mean to create the melody and first verse of “Exile” on girlfriend Taylor Swift’s “Folklore” album.
At least that’s what he tells GQ magazine.
“It was really the most accidental thing to happen in lockdown,” he told the publication. “It wasn’t like, ‘It’s three o’clock, it’s time to write a song!’ It was just messing around on a piano and singing badly and being overheard and then thinking, you know, what if we tried to get to the end of it together?”
Using the pseudonym William Bowery, Alwyn received two co-writing credits on “Folklore” and three on the followup album to that one, “Evermore.”
The couple kept it a secret, he said, because “the idea was that people would just listen to the music rather than focus on the fact that we wrote it together.”
But word got out – and the pair, who are known to be very private about their relationship, ended up scoring some Grammys thanks to their collaboration.
He doesn’t mind talking about the music, but of course he’s not willing to discuss his relationship with Swift.
Alwyn, whose TV series “Conversations with Friends,” premieres this month, is aware of his rep for playing things close to the vest.
“I’m sure I’ve come across as guarded in the past,” he said. “And it’s a mix of me being British and having a private life. But I don’t want to be going into these things guarded.”",2022-05-10 12:36:06

Until now, Taylor Swift has switched up her collaborators and general sound with each album. But she has rightly billed “Evermore,” her surprise-release ninth album, as the “sister” to the one she released less than five months ago, “Folklore.”
“It feels like we were standing on the edge of the folklorian woods and had a choice: to turn and go back or to travel further into the forest of this music,” Swift wrote in a statement. “We chose to wander deeper in.”
She continued writing songs with the “Folklore” brain trust of producers and musicians — primarily Aaron Dessner of the National, who plays most of the instruments and collaborated on 14 of 15 songs.

Taylor Swift looked “bejeweled” on the Golden Globes red carpet on Sunday when she showed up wearing a shimmering bright green gown.
The superstar’s concert film “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” is nominated in the Globes’ new category for cinematic and box office achievement, marking her fifth Golden Globe nomination to date. She was previously nominated for four best original song Golden Globes, including at last year’s ceremony for the song “Carolina” from the movie “Where the Crawdads Sings.”
Swift’s boyfriend Travis Kelce – who also happens to be in Los Angeles on Sunday for the Kansas City Chiefs game against the Los Angeles Chargers – did not join Swift on the red carpet.
The last time Swift attended the Globes was in 2020 with ex-boyfriend Joe Alwyn when her song “Beautiful Ghosts” from the film “Cats” was up for a Globe.
Following a banner year last year as Swift embarked upon her record-breaking “Eras Tour” that kicked off in March 2023, her concert film premiered in theaters in October.
Taking the movie straight to theater chain AMC to distribute it, Swift broke tradition by skipping over a theatrical distribution partnership with a studio or streamer amid the dual Hollywood strikes last year.
The film certainly proved to be a box office achievement, raking in just under $100 million in domestic release, per AMC’s opening weekend estimates, and shattering the overall record for any concert film.
Along with “Barbie,” Swift’s concert film is credited with helping to boost the theater industry as it continues to recover from the pandemic.
“Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” is nominated in the new box office category on Sunday alongside “Barbie,” “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” “John Wick: Chapter 4,” “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,” “Oppenheimer,” “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,” and “The Super Mario Bros.

Taylor Swift has released the highly anticipated title track off her upcoming seventh studio album, “Lover,” and the internet is in a tizzy trying to decipher her lyrics.
Is she engaged? Is she living with boyfriend Joe Alwyn?
“I’ve loved you three summers now, honey / But I want them all,” sings Swift, who has been dating Alwyn for exactly that long.
Some listeners are speculating Swift’s is hinting at an engagement to the British actor. The lyrics “My heart’s been borrowed and yours has been blue,” sound similar to “something borrowed, something blue” line from the classic wedding rhyme.
“Ladies and gentleman / Will you please stand / With every guitar string scar on my hand / I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover,” she sings in the song.
Taylor Swift - Lover (Official Lyric Video)
She talks about living with someone she wants to remain “this close” to, “Can I go where you go?”
In the sweet tune, friends stay over in the living room, the Christmas tree stays up way past New Year’s, and the couple enjoy nights out then going home together.
The singer, who likes to drop early hints for her fans which later turn out to have a deeper meaning, will include 120 pages of diary pages written throughout her life in special editions of her upcoming album, “Lover.”

Taylor Swift's new album Reputation drops on Friday and details have been scarce - until now.
The singer has finally confirmed the name of the 15 tracks on her upcoming release.
This being Taylor Swift, it has led to speculation about who the songs could be about.
Since her last album, 1989, she has been through several public break-ups and falling-outs with other stars.
So who could she be talking about on her latest release? Here are some suggestions.
The boyfriend: Joe Alwyn

British actor Joe Alwyn may be the inspiration behind several romantic songs on Taylor's new album
Joe, 26, is believed to be Taylor's current boyfriend and it's likely she's talking about him on Call It What You Want.
She sings about ""her baby"" on the song and how he helped her overcome ""drama queens"" and ""jokers"".
And it would make sense if new song King Of My Heart was also about Joe. If not - well that's a bit awkward.
Songs such as ...Ready For It?, Delicate and Dancing With Our Hands Tied also hint at being about current romance, rather than side-eyeing any exes.
The A-list enemies: Kanye and Kim

Taylor Swift fell out with Kanye and Kim over a sexual reference to her in one of the rapper's songs
Taylor's worldwide hit Look What You Made Me Do is thought to be about Kanye and Kim, after he referenced her in his song Famous.
On 1989, Taylor teamed up with Kendrick Lamar to seemingly take down Katy Perry on her single Bad Blood.
And it looks like she's lining up her enemies in her sights again with the ominously titled End Game, this time featuring Future and Ed Sheeran.
The ex: Tom Hiddleston

Avengers actor Tom could be the older boyfriend Taylor mentions in her song Gorgeous
Taylor, 27, dated actor Tom Hiddleston, 36, for three months in 2016, eventually separating in September of last year.
Her song Gorgeous may touch upon the break-up, with lyrics ""And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us"" suggesting the song is about when she met someone closer to her age - Joe Alywn perhaps.
The other ex: Calvin Harris

Calvin Harris is one of Taylor's big romances since she released her last album, 1989
Taylor has kept things sweet with most of her exes, but things with Calvin Harris turned sour when he lashed out at her on Twitter in July 2016.
He posted a string of angry tweets after Taylor confirmed she co-wrote his hit This Is What You Came For, and in those tweets referenced her then-relationship with Tom Hiddleston.
So could her new song Don't Blame Me be about her bumpy ride with Calvin?

Taylor Swift took to Twitter to criticise Ginny and Georgia, calling its joke about her ""deeply sexist""
Taylor Swift has accused a Netflix show of ""degrading"" women for featuring a joke she branded ""deeply sexist"".
The pop star tweeted to criticise the joke, which was in the season finale of comedy-drama Ginny and Georgia.
In one scene, main characters Ginny Miller and her mother Georgia argued about relationships.
Asked whether she had broken up with her boyfriend, Ginny said: ""What do you care? You go through men faster than Taylor Swift.""
The line incurred the wrath of Swift's fans, prompting criticism of the show and its cast members on social media. Some Swift fans even called for a boycott of the series.
On Monday, Swift herself addressed the controversy in a tweet, writing: ""Hey Ginny & Georgia, 2010 called and it wants its lazy, deeply sexist joke back.""

Netflix has not yet commented on the criticism, nor has anyone associated with Ginny and Georgia.
Swift's love life has long been in the media spotlight.
Swift has been in a relationship with 30-year-old British actor Joe Alwyn for several years.
The couple have largely kept their relationship private -although Alwyn is considered to be the subject of her 2019 track London Boy, in which she sang about her experiences in the city.
The actor has also co-written songs on Swift's two most recent albums, Folklore and Evermore, under the pseudonym William Bowery.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ladies and gentlemen, the Era's Tour continues. Taylor Swift is in the building. Here to check out the Jets and the Chiefs, but more specifically, obviously, Travis Kelce.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN ANCHOR: Taylor Swift's football era, it continues. Really putting the NFL on the map.
POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: That was a good one. She's putting the NFL on the map. Finally people are paying attention. The second straight week she watched Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs in action.
HARLOW: Her trip to Met Life Stadium closely documented, as you can see. Cameras cut to her, oh, just 17 times during the broadcast. She showed up with some famous friends, Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman also there. Her presence adding to the swirl of questions about her relationship with Kelce.
MATTINGLY: Did you know there was actually a game last night, too? A football game. And it was a pretty exciting one, where the Kansas City Chiefs beat the New York Jets 23-20.
Joining us now to discuss this budding romance, Constance Grady, senior correspondent at ""Vox"" and ""Vanity Fair"" contributor Kase Wickman.
Guys, appreciate you being here.
The thing that I actually appreciate about this, as both an NFL fan and somebody who enjoys Taylor Swift's music, is it's just fun. Like, I don't want to think too deeply about it. And yet everyone is talking about it. Why?
KASE WICKMAN, CONTRIBUTOR, ""VANITY FAIR"": I mean, she does literally have a song called ""Mastermind."" So, you know, Taylor Swift sees what -- or we see what Taylor Swift wants us to see. It's -- it's just fun, you know? She's the queen of the easter egg. She's dropping clues everywhere. It's just fun to watch her, and she knows that.
HARLOW: You know what's interesting -- first of all, she's with Donna Kelce, the brothers' mother, who I just love, love, love, love. I got to talk to her before the Super Bowl and she's amazing. They look like they're having a lot of fun.
Taylor's last relationship was very private.
CONSTANCE GRADY, SENIOR CORRESPONDENT, ""VOX"": Yes, she was --
HARLOW: So, this is different.
GRADY: She was with Joe Alwyn for six years. And they were very rarely photographed together, seen together. She wrote a lot of songs that she dedicated to him. But that was really all we saw of their relationship.
But this is kind of a return to form for her. Before her Joe Alwyn relationship she was photographed a lot with her boyfriends. She kind of would use the photographs as sort of teasers for the songs that would come next. And I think we're seeing that a little bit here. That's part of the fun of this relationship, or potential relationship, is you can just sort of think, what song is Taylor Swift going to write about dating a football star? That sounds really cool.
MATTINGLY: And terrifying if you're the football star. It is.
This is not me, but to play devil's advocate I had a friend say, this is all an act, right? You have -
WICKMAN: A friend? A friend?
MATTINGLY: She's on - I'm not going to name names here because I don't want anybody to get destroyed on social media for ever challenging Taylor Swift and her intentions. But, you know, they show her 17 times last night. One of the times, I think, went straight into her movie, which is coming out and has already sold out everywhere. Is this real?
WICKMAN: Maybe? Yes. Yes. They're spending time together. They're -- I mean they're both very much in the public eye and are very aware of that. Ye, I mean, there hasn't been any - any hard confirmation from either side. No one's, yes, you know, it got my -- TNT. But, you know, they're definitely spending time together. But it's - it's definitely good for both of them I'd say no matter what. They're raising each other's profiles. I mean I am not a habitual Sunday night football watcher.
MATTINGLY: Yes.
WICKMAN: And I watched -- I watched the Taylor Swift game last night.
HARLOW: The Taylor Swift game. Guys, that says it all. Not the Jets/Chiefs games but the Taylor Swift game.
MATTINGLY: All right, we've got a lot of Jets fans in here who were more than happy to give that to Taylor Swift. HARLOW: But in all seriousness, I mean the NFL already rates really high, but now rates are up even more. She was on his podcasts. Who does this help more?
GRADY: I mean, I think very clearly Taylor Swift does not need help to go mainstream in a way that Travis Kelce does. He's, obviously, a very big deal. He's won two Super Bowls. But he is only now starting to cross over into the mainstream. Since she showed up at his game last week for the first time, sales of his jersey have gone up like 400 percent. He's picked up over a million followers across social media. This is really making him a mainstream star in a way he never was before.
It's good for Taylor's profile too, but she does not need that kind of help.
HARLOW: Yes.
MATTINGLY: It's good that - I mean Taylor Swift finally putting Travis Kelce on the map, right?
WICKMAN: She's a cross-over hit.
MATTINGLY: Like, it was important for people - for people to finally figure out that he's OK at football. Their podcast is great, by the way. Shout out to Luna, your daughter, who thought you were going to be on stage with Taylor Swift -
WICKMAN: Oh, thank you.
HARLOW: Hi Luna!
MATTINGLY: This morning and instead it was with us, but we still say hi.
We'd like to thank you, guys. Appreciate it, as always.
WICKMAN: Thank you.
GRADY: Thank you.

And my understanding is he's pretty upset and angry about it. It's part of the reason why he's actually physically showing up today. What's your sense of what actually happens going forward here?
ERROL LOUIS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: He's in a lot of trouble. This is - this does strike at the heart of things. It's different from all of the criminal cases. Put all of that aside. This is long standing practices by Donald Trump for which he's now being held to account. And what this could do is cancel his ability to easily do business in New York and really harm his ability to get financing, to continue to sort of run his real estate empire. That is -- that's - that's real serious. And, frankly, it does, as the clip suggested, it goes to the heart of who he is and his public presentation.
And so this kind of undermines a big part of his case. Even his political opponents back in 2016 never really went there and said, you know, he's kind of a fraud as a businessman. He kind of lies about the value of his properties. He's not as rich as he says. Nobody really sort of got into that. A court might end up finding that. And that could have -- that introduces a new part of the political conversation that we have not heard up until now.
HARLOW: You have (INAUDIBLE).
JOHN AVLON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: I think that's -- I think that's right. And I think also that the fact that Trump's going to be in court today, where he's tried to avoid, you know, situations where he might be - be under oath because he takes this so personally I think makes it a moment that is worthy of our attention. This is not the kind of, you know, coverage that's procedural. This is a big moment for the exact reasons that Errol said. This is a guy whose entire rise is predicated upon the idea that he's a very rich, successful billionaire.
HARLOW: You know, the fact that you said that, because it's a civil trial, he doesn't have to be in court. He will have to be in court for the criminal trial coming up.
AVLON: Yes.
HARLOW: He didn't go to the E. Jean Carroll trial, for example.
AVLON: Right.
HARLOW: What does that tell us about what is important to him?
AVLON: It's all about the money. It's all about the benjamins. And Michael Cohen, his former consiglieri, made this point. You know, this is something that's been hiding in plain sight. And it's not like getting Al Capone on tax evasion, as some people have suggested, because it does go to the core of his identity and he will -- he's taking this personally. And that judge's initial - you know, that was a blistering attack.
HARLOW: And the judge gets to decide this one.
AVLON: Yes.
HARLOW: Not a jury. The same judge. AVLON: Yes.
MATTINGLY: Which is an interesting -- it's a great point because the former president attacked the judge -
HARLOW: Yes.
MATTINGLY: Along with Letitia James in a social media post last night. You're a lawyer. Would you advise attacking the judge who (INAUDIBLE)?
LOUIS: Oh, no. Oh, no you don't. Especially if there's no jury. I mean, you know, it's one thing to attack the process and the court because you're trying to sort of, you know, sort of identify one or two jurors that you can flip to your side. In this case the judge is the whole case and the judge is going to determine the law and the judge has already determined, as a matter of law, that this is somebody who has committed a lot of fraud. So, he's really kind of on the back foot. I mean he's kind of coming in here as an underdog. That's probably why he's showing up in person.
But, no, you don't - you don't attack the court. You don't attack the law. I mean they - they repeated the same arguments over and over again and the judge slapped it down, sanctioned the lawyers, fined them each $7,500.
HARLOW: Right.
LOUIS: And, you know, this -- you can't just keep saying it. Like, I get it, he - he says this is how real estate is done. I've lied about Trump Tower for years. It's only 58 stories tall, but I charge people more if I say it's 68 floors, you know.
But the judge has said, you - you can't - you can't do that to an extreme. You -- and you don't get to put an asterisk at the bottom of it saying, you know, everything in my financial statement, you know, has not been checked - has not been fully audited. It might be a lie. That's not how you do commercial business. And that's really what the judge has said.
Attacking him for saying that, I don't know if it's going to change his mind.
AVLON: Attacking the judge, attacking the court, attacking the system of laws is what Donald Trump does. But this is a place where he gets -- could get in trouble.
HARLOW: And just one thing to note, it's not a jury, because that's what Donald Trump's legal team chose, by the way, right?
LOUIS: That's right. He has the right to a jury. He - he --
HARLOW: So that's just really going to be interesting to see how that choice plays out.
Merrick Garland last night --
AVLON: Yes.
HARLOW: Everyone might not have seen it last night. Scott Pelley did a brilliant interview, I thought, with Merrick Garland. And at one point - we showed you him responding to criticism. But at one point later in the interview, Merrick Garland chokes up and he is talking about democracy and his family history and some of his family members fleeing the Nazis, not surviving. It was just really interesting to see that perspective from him given all of the incoming that he's facing, all of the criticism for how the department has handled a number of the probes here, including the Hunter Biden probe. Just given his history and to see that from him, I was struck.
AVLON: That's the legacy that we all are here to defend, all our families. And we forget sometimes in the day to day thrust and perry of politics that what's really at stake is democracy, it's self- government. And that's something we should all feel emotionally about. Merrick Garland's getting heat from some on the left who says he didn't move fast enough, while Donald Trump and everybody says it's a - he's been radical and a witch hunt.
[06:45:02]
This is about equal justice under law. This is about defending principles that are bigger than all of us. And it should provoke that kind of emotion.
HARLOW: Thank you, guys, very much. Errol, John, appreciate it.
AVLON: Thanks, guys.
MATTINGLY: Well, it's too hot in the twin cities. An annual marathon in Minnesota canceled just hours before it was supposed to start. Poppy, how did you let that happen?
HARLOW: I - well, I know. That's all my mom was talking about all weekend is how hot it is at home. But I feel for those folks who were all looking forward to the run. You do not expect this in October in Minnesota.
MATTINGLY: No, but you also don't want to run in hot weather.
HARLOW: Don't you know.
Meantime, from freedom of speech to gun rights and abortion access, the Supreme Court has a busy term ahead. A really significant one for the country. We'll break it down, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HARLOW: A live look at the Supreme Court this morning as the sun comes up in Washington. The court justices set to begin a new term today. They have a packed docket ahead of them.
[06:50:00]
Major cases include Second Amendment, gun rights, abortion, social media and government regulation. The high court faces all of this amid growing concerns about ethics and lack of standards for the justices themselves on that front.
The public is not pleased with the court right now. A new Gallup poll shows the Supreme Court approval rating is just 41 percent.
Joan Biskupic joins us live from Washington.
I know you'll be down there as they take the bench.
JOAN BISKUPIC, SENIOR SUPREME COURT ANALYST: I will.
HARLOW: Joan, it's good to see you.
Walk us through the big, big cases ahead for them this term.
BISKUPIC: Sure. Good morning, Poppy and Phil.
Yes, a real sense of excitement, appreciation, but also, as you say, new scrutiny for their off-bench behavior.
First of all, a major Second Amendment case. Back in 2022, the justices really limited what states can do on gun control by saying that judges would interpret the statutes based on the text, history and tradition of the Second Amendment. And that caused a judge - a set of judges down in the southwest part of the country to strike down a federal ban on gun possession if someone has had a domestic violence restraining order. So it's a case where the federal government has come up and appealed and said, look, we can still look to text, history and tradition of the Second Amendment but states in the federal government still must be able to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people and citizens who are not law abiding. So that's an important case where we'll get some more clarity, I believe, in this upcoming term on the reach of the second amendment.
Another case involves - a series of cases involves the power of federal regulators, for example, over the environment, public safety, consumer choices. And tomorrow, Poppy and Phil, the justices are going to hear a case that involves the federal agency that was set up after the 2008 financial crisis to protect consumers from scams. And this involves a challenge to its funding mechanism, which doesn't really - they don't get much - the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau doesn't get money through the regular appropriations that Congress would do each year, but rather from the Federal Reserve system. And there's a question on that agency's - the constitutionality of that funding. But it would - it - if the court rules against the agency, it could jeopardize the last 12 years of decisions that have protected consumers when it comes to mortgages, credit cards, car loans.
And then finally I want to mention one - another one already on the calendar, and this involves social media companies and whether states, in this situation Florida and Texas, can limit what platforms, such as Facebook, are able to take down from their platforms - content that they - they might find would be misleading or false. And it's a big First Amendment question, Poppy. MATTINGLY: Joan, the court may also take up the case on Mifepristone, right? The challenge to the availability of the commonly used abortion pill. We've been talking about this now for months. This would be the next major, dramatic abortion related case. The first since Dobbs. How do you think the court's going to handle this?
BISKUPIC: That's right. This is the first one since 2022, when they just rolled back the right to - the constitutional right to abortion. This one will be different, I think, Phil and Poppy, because it not only involves the abortion medication drug Mifepristone, it involves the federal Food and Drug Administration's authority to use its own expertise to say what drugs are safe and effective.
So, you've got two things a stake here, the availability of this drug that's now used for most abortions nationwide, but also the federal agency - again, it goes to federal regulatory power, that's, right now, tasked with deciding what drugs should be put on the market.
HARLOW: Yes, all this while they deal with major ethics concerns and what the code of conduct is going to be.
Joan, we're going to have you back soon to talk about that and a lot more.
BISKUPIC: OK.
HARLOW: Thank you very much.
BISKUPIC: Thank you.
MATTINGLY: So, just how good is Simone Biles? I'll answer that. Very good. Well, she now has a fifth move named after you - her, and we're going to show it to you, next.
HARLOW: Also, Kevin McCarthy facing threats to his speakership from inside his own conference. Will this moment lead to bipartisanship or just more division?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. BYRON DONALDS (R-FL): I think he is in trouble.
But I'm just going to be totally blunt, there are a lot of trust issues in my chamber right now.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
[06:58:20]
MATTINGLY: Well, this just in, the Nobel committee announcing that a Hungarian and U.S. scientist have jointly won the Nobel Prize in Medicine. Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman were awarded the prize for their discoveries that enabled the development of the effective MRNA vaccines against Covid-19. HARLOW: Major congratulations to them.
Also, sad for a lot of runners in Minnesota this weekend. The annual Twin Cities Marathon canceled on Sunday after record heat swept the region. The high Sunday in Minneapolis/St. Paul, 92 degrees. That broke the record for an October day. It was about 26 degrees above normal. Organizers said the heat made it just to risky to run this year. The marathon draws about 8,000 runners, 300,000 spectators. Some runners decided to o for it anyways, look at them, good or them, reaching the finish line by noon.
MATTINGLY: Well, Simone Biles making more history at the World Gymnastics Championships in Belgium.
(VIDEO CLIP)
MATTINGLY: Biles became the first woman to land the Yurchenko double pike vault during an international competition. I often practice that at home. That's a move historically done by men. So, by rule, the women's version will be named after her. It is now called the ""Biles 2,"" which is the fifth gymnastic element bearing her name in the vault, floor exercise and balance beam.
HARLOW: That is just breathtaking every time I watch her.
MATTINGLY: My efforts to practice doing that myself?
HARLOW: No.
MATTINGLY: Oh, Simone Biles.
HARLOW: And that me like the worst vision, by the way, Phil, of you trying to do that at home. Simone Biles is breathtaking. Sorry.
MATTINGLY: I'm athletic. Come on.
HARLOW: I (INAUDIBLE) Mattingly -
MATTINGLY: She is remarkable. And I love the comeback.
[07:00:00]
And she is as darn good as everybody thinks she is.
HARLOW: Totally. Totally.
MATTINGLY: I love it.
