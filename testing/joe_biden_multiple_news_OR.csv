A robocall that appears to be an AI voice resembling President Joe Biden is reaching out to New Hampshire residents, advising them against voting in Tuesday’s presidential primary and saving their vote for the November general election.
Audio of the call was reviewed by CNN from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo. Their tracking data suggests a large volume of calls. It’s unclear who is behind the call.
“Republicans have been trying to push nonpartisan and Democratic voters to participate in their primary. What a bunch of malarkey,” says the digitally altered Biden voice. “We know the value of voting Democratic when our votes count. It’s important that you save your vote for the November election. We’ll need your help in electing Democrats up and down the ticket. Voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again.”
The application rates the number of calls, which were first reported by NBC News, as “severe,” among its highest rating for calls.
Nomorobo CEO Aaron Foss told CNN their data showed that 76% of the robocalls targeted New Hampshire, with 12% directed at Boston and the remaining 12% covering other areas. They estimated the number of these fraudulent calls ranged from 5,000 to 25,000.
Biden’s name will not appear on the ballot in the upcoming New Hampshire primary on Tuesday over a dispute between the state and the Democratic National Committee, which voted to move the New Hampshire primary out of its traditional first-in-the nation position. As a result, there is an organized effort to write-in Biden’s name.
“This matter has already been referred to the New Hampshire Attorney General, and the campaign is actively discussing additional actions to take immediately. Spreading disinformation to suppress voting and deliberately undermine free and fair elections will not stand, and fighting back against any attempt to undermine our democracy will continue to be a top priority for this campaign,” Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Biden’s campaign manager, said in a statement.
Aaron Jacobs, a spokesperson for Write-In Biden, said in a statement, “This is deep fake disinformation designed to harm Joe Biden, suppress votes, and damage our democracy,” adding that the group remains “focused on one goal until polls close on Tuesday: encouraging Granite Staters to write-in Joe Biden.”
At the end of the call, the voice of an unknown male directs listeners to call a local New Hampshire number to be removed from future calls.
The call uses spoofing, a common practice in fraudulent robocalling which manipulates caller ID information to display a false phone number, obscuring the true identity of the caller.
The robocall shows up on caller ID as a local New Hampshire number that belongs to Kathy Sullivan, a former New Hampshire Democratic Party chair and treasurer for the Granite for America PAC. The PAC is working to encourage voters to write in Biden’s name this Tuesday.
In a phone interview, Sullivan, who is supporting Biden in the 2024 election, said she first received calls on Sunday night and spoke with the New Hampshire attorney general’s office on Monday to file a complaint over the robocall.
“It’s very apparent that there’s someone, or someones, out there who want to suppress the primary write-in vote on Tuesday, tomorrow, by sending out this robocall saying, ‘Don’t vote for Joe Biden,’ or Joe Biden saying, ‘Don’t vote on Tuesday, save your vote until November,’” said Sullivan. “It’s voter suppression by someone who wants to hurt Joe Biden.”
Sullivan said she believes her phone was listed as a way to “jam” up her phone lines.
“It’s personally annoying, but more importantly it’s just reprehensible that someone would be trying to suppress the vote by telling people not to vote on Tuesday,” she said. “That’s an interference with our democracy. It doesn’t get much worse than that.”
The campaign of Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, who is challenging Biden in the New Hampshire primary, found out about the call from reporter outreach last night, according to spokesperson Katie Dolan.
“Any effort to discourage voters is disgraceful and an unacceptable affront to democracy,” Dolan said in a statement. “The potential use of AI to manipulate voters is deeply disturbing.”

Joe Biden said he “shouldn’t have been such a wise guy” on Friday hours after he told a popular African American radio host that anyone struggling to decide whether to support him or President Donald Trump in the general election “ain’t black.”
The presumptive Democratic nominee’s comment came at the end of an at times tense interview with Charlamagne tha God on “The Breakfast Club.”
A staffer interjected that Biden needed to go, and Charlamagne shot back: “You can’t do that to black media!”
“I do that to white media and black media because my wife has to go on at 6 o’clock,” Biden said, referring to his wife Jill Biden apparently needing to use the broadcast studio they’ve built in their basement in Delaware as the coronavirus pandemic has knocked Biden off the campaign trail. Glancing at his watch, Biden said, “uh oh, I’m in trouble.”
Charlamagne told Biden that he should come to the studio in New York City for another interview, telling the former vice president that “we’ve got more questions.”
“You’ve got more questions?” Biden replied. “Well I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.”
Charlamagne responded, “It don’t have nothing to do with Trump. It has to do with the fact, I want something for my community.”
“Take a look at my record, man!” Biden shot back.
Later on Friday afternoon, Biden addressed his comments in a call with the US Black Chamber of Commerce, saying, “I shouldn’t have been so cavalier” and insisting he doesn’t take black voters for granted.
“The bottom line of all of this perhaps I was much too cavalier. I know that the comments have come off like I was taking the African American vote for granted but nothing could be further from the truth. I’ve never, ever done that and I’ve earned it every time I’ve run,” he said.
“I was making the point that I never take the vote for granted and in fact I know in order to win the presidency, I need the African American vote,” Biden said. “I shouldn’t have been such a wise guy. I shouldn’t have been so cavalier.”
Biden at times during the 2020 race has quickly become testy when challenged over his record by groups the former vice president believes would fare worse under Trump. In November, he told a protester criticizing former President Barack Obama’s record on deportations that “you should vote for Trump.”

The interview was Biden’s first appearance on “The Breakfast Club,” a popular nationally syndicated radio show broadcast from New York City that other leading Democratic presidential candidates appeared on during the primary.
Charlamagne said during an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett on Friday night that the former vice president’s comments were “just a shock coming from an old white man like Joe Biden.”
He called Biden “a very intricate part” of the legal system disenfranchising black Americans. He cited Biden’s role in legislation such as the 1994 crime bill, which expanded the federal death penalty and created dramatically harsher sentencing laws including “three strikes,” mandatory life terms for people with at least three federal violent crime or drug convictions.
If Biden wants to be president, he needs to “really help the people that have helped Democrats, all of these years,” Charlamagne added.
Biden’s win in the Democratic primary was fueled primarily by his support from African American voters, particularly older ones, who catapulted him to the win in South Carolina that set the stage for Biden to all but end the race in the following weeks.
A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday found Biden with 81% support among black voters to Trump’s 3%.
“Vice President Biden has spent his career fighting alongside and for the African American community. He won his party’s nomination by earning every vote and meeting people where they are and that’s exactly what he intends to do this November,” senior Biden adviser Symone Sanders said of the interview on Twitter.
She added: “The comments made at the end of the Breakfast Club interview were in jest, but let’s be clear about what the VP was saying: he was making the distinction that he would put his record with the African American community up against Trump’s any day. Period.”
Trump’s campaign used Biden’s comment to portray him as taking black voters for granted.
Katrina Pierson, a Trump campaign senior adviser, said in a statement that Biden “believes black men and women are incapable of being independent or free thinking.”
Trump in 2016 argued that black voters should reject Democrats who he argued had taken their votes for granted and back him, saying, “What the hell do you have to lose?”
Biden has frequently criticized Trump’s history of racist comments and actions, which includes questioning former President Barack Obama’s citizenship, expressing frustration with immigrants from “s***hole countries” and referring to white supremacist protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, and counter-protesters by saying there were “very fine people on both sides.”
In the radio interview, Biden declined to name people on his list of those being considered for the vice presidential nomination, but said:”I guarantee you, there are multiple black women being considered. Multiple.”
Charlamagne pressed Biden on his role in enacting the 1994 crime bill as a US senator, which Biden defended, saying Hillary Clinton was “wrong” in 2016 to apologize for it and that Republicans had insisted on the inclusion of mandatory minimum sentencing.
Biden also defended his calls to decriminalize marijuana, rather than legalize it. He said that before legalizing it, he wants to wait and see the results of studies on “what it affects, doesn’t affect in long-term development of the brain. And we should wait till the studies are done.”
“I think we got decades of studies from actual weed smokers though,” Charlamagne cut in.
“Yeah, I do,” Biden said. “I know a lot of weed smokers.”

By Max Matza BBC News
Listen: AI-generated robocall impersonates Joe Biden's voice
A fake robocall claiming to be from US President Joe Biden has urged voters to skip Tuesday's primary election in New Hampshire.
An investigation has been opened into the calls, which are suspected to have been artificially generated.
It is unclear who created the audio. The Trump campaign has denied involvement.
In the message, a voice tells voters to ""save"" their ballot for the general election in November.
""Republicans have been trying to push nonpartisan and Democratic voters to participate in their primary. What a bunch of malarkey,"" says the message.
But there is no rule that says people who vote in a primary cannot cast a ballot in the general election, so there is no reason to ""save"" a vote.
The New Hampshire attorney general's office said in a statement: ""Although the voice in the robocall sounds like the voice of President Biden, this message appears to be artificially generated based on initial indications.""
It added that the ""messages appear to be an unlawful attempt to disrupt"" the election on Tuesday, and that ""voters should disregard the content of this message entirely"".
To recipients, the robocalls falsely appeared to be coming from the personal mobile phone number of a former state Democratic chairwoman, Kathy Sullivan, who helps run a pro-Biden political group in New Hampshire.

""This call links back to my personal cell phone number without my permission,"" she said in a statement, calling it ""outright election interference"".
Anti-robocall application Nomorobo estimates the calls were placed between 5,000 and 25,000 times, reports CNN.
On Monday, White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed that the audio was fake. Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez criticised the call as an attempt to ""suppress voting and deliberately undermine free and fair elections"".
In the New Hampshire primary, voters from both main parties are picking which candidate should be their standard-bearer in this year's general election.
Though Mr Biden's name will not appear on the New Hampshire primary ballot, a campaign led by state and local Democrats has taken shape for voters to write in his name.
The decision to remove his name came after Mr Biden approved a new voting calendar that stripped New Hampshire of its status as the first state to hold a primary.",2024-01-22 23:39:43
https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/biden-midterm-election-voter-rights-legitimate/index.html,Did Joe Biden really say that the 2022 election could be ‘illegitimate’?,"At Wednesday’s press conference, President Joe Biden was asked a simple question. It was this: “Speaking of voting rights legislation, if this isn’t passed, do you still believe the upcoming election will be fairly conducted and its results will be legitimate?”","CNN —
At Wednesday’s press conference, President Joe Biden was asked a simple question. It was this: “Speaking of voting rights legislation, if this isn’t passed, do you still believe the upcoming election will be fairly conducted and its results will be legitimate?”
The easy answer – and the one Biden’s White House wishes he gave – goes something like this: “Yes, despite all of the Republicans’ attempts to limit who can vote and when, I ultimately have faith in the American political system’s ability to produce a free and fair election.”
He didn’t say that. What he did say has ignited a debate about whether Biden believes that the 2022 election could well be illegitimate – so much so that White House press secretary Jen Psaki was forced to clarify via tweet on Thursday morning: “Lets be clear: @potus was not casting doubt on the legitimacy of the 2022 election.”
In an attempt to clear all of this up, let’s go through what Biden actually said.
First, here’s what Biden said in response to that first question about whether the 2022 results will be legitimate:
“Well, it all depends on whether or not we’re able to make the case to the American people that some of this is being set up to try to alter the outcome of the election. … I think if, in fact – no matter how hard they make it for minorities to vote, I think you’re going to see them willing to stand in line and – and defy the attempt to keep them from being able to vote. I think you’re going to see the people who they’re trying to keep from being able to show up, showing up and making the sacrifice that needs to make in order to change the law back to what it should be.”
So, Biden appears to be answering two different questions here – neither of which are the one he was asked.
In the first part of his answer, he is suggesting that the legitimacy (or not) of the election is tied to his (and his party’s) ability to make the case to the public about the restrictive voting rights measures passed in the wake of the 2020 election in places like Florida and Georgia.
Then Biden pivots to say that, no matter what, minority voters will show up to vote in 2022, which has zero to do with the original question about whether the election might be illegitimate.
Because of the questions that first answer raised, another reporter follows up with Biden. Here’s that exchange:
Reporter: “A moment ago, you were asked whether or not you believed that we would have free and fair elections in 2022 if some of these state legislatures reformed their voting protocols. You said that it depends. Do you – do you think that they would in any way be illegitimate?”
Biden: “Oh, yeah, I think it easily could be – be illegitimate. Imagine – imagine if, in fact, Trump has succeeded in convincing Pence to not count the votes.”
Reporter: “In regard to 2022, sir – the midterm elections.”
Biden: “Oh, 2022. I mean, imagine if those attempts to say that the count was not legit. You have to recount it and we’re not going to count – we’re going to discard the following votes. I mean, sure, but – I’m not going to say it’s going to be legit. It’s – the increase and the prospect of being illegitimate is in direct proportion to us not being able to get these – these reforms passed.”
So, Biden is asked to clarify his view on 2022, but appears to misunderstand the question – answering instead about the possibility that the 2020 election could have been illegitimate. Biden’s line –“I think it easily could be – be illegitimate” – that is being quoted everywhere today is clearly a reference to 2020 as he follows it with “if…Trump had succeeded in convincing Pence to not count the votes.”
The reporter interjects to make sure Biden knows the question isn’t about the legitimacy of the 2020 election. Biden course corrects – “Oh, 2022” – then gives what is, at best, a confusing answer. He uses an odd phrasing – “I’m not going to say it’s going to be legit” – and then directly links the legitimacy of the 2022 election to getting major voting reform legislation passed at the federal level. Legislation, it’s worth noting, that has no chance of passing before the 2022 election.
What, then, can we conclude? A few things:
1) Biden never said the 2022 election would be illegitimate. His quote about an election “easily” being illegitimate is quite clearly him referring to the 2020 race.
2) Biden never really answers the question he was asked in any sort of definitive way.
3) Biden ties passage of federal voting rights legislation to the likely legitimacy of the 2022 election.
In short: Biden was vague and unclear at just the wrong moment. As the former president of the United States seeks to undermine faith in American elections, the current occupant of the White House needs to affirm free and fairness of the vote in the most blunt terms possible. Biden didn’t come close to doing that on Wednesday.",2022-01-20 16:34:31

On Wednesday, Our Revolution is planning to send an email to 87,000 members in Michigan and to about 225,000 supporters in other states, encouraging them to vote Uncommitted in the state’s Feb. 27 primary to “push Biden to change course on Gaza now.”
Former Representative Andy Levin, Democrat of Michigan and a signee of the letter, said Mr. Biden was at risk of having voters sit out the November election in protest of U.S. policy toward the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. He warned that Mr. Biden could lose the state to former President Donald J. Trump in the general election without a major change in Israel policy.
“I am working with some people who feel like they will never vote for Joe Biden, but there are many, many, many I feel will vote for Joe Biden on Nov. 5 if he changes course,” Mr. Levin said in an interview Tuesday evening. “This is the best way I can help Joe Biden.”",2024-02-14 10:04:01

President Joe Biden issued a dire and angry warning Tuesday that the very underpinnings of American democracy were under threat, calling an ongoing assault on voting rights the gravest challenge to American democracy since the Civil War.
But he stopped short of embracing changes to Senate procedure that might open the door to new laws protecting those rights, a step activists have said is essential as they urge the President to say and do more on an issue he’s said is the most important of his presidency.
The President’s speech in Philadelphia, the birthplace of American democracy, was meant as an opening salvo in what officials say will be an ongoing push against restrictive voting laws being passed around the nation.
In it, Biden took particular aim at his predecessor Donald Trump and other Republicans who have refused to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election, accusing them of fomenting a pattern of denial that is fracturing the country’s foundations.
“In America, if you lose, you accept the results,” Biden said inside the soaring atrium of the National Constitution Center. “You follow the Constitution, you try again. You don’t call facts ‘fake’ and then try to bring down the American experiment just because you’re unhappy. That’s not statesmanship. That’s selfishness.”
It was the most forcefully Biden has inveighed against Trump since taking office. At one point, accusing Republicans of shirking truth and responsibility for upholding the Constitution, he bellowed: “Have you no shame?”
One of the fieriest speeches of Biden’s presidency to date, Biden’s remarks reflected the fury he and fellow Democrats have cultivated as Republicans follow Trump’s lead in denying the election results. He predicted it is likely Republicans will use a similar strategy in the 2022 midterms, saying “we have to prepare now.”
He called efforts to call the election in question “dark” and “sinister” on Tuesday, saying they reflected “human nature at its worst.”
“Bullies and merchants of fear, peddlers of lies, are threatening the very foundation of our country,” Biden said.
Still, his avoidance of the filibuster issue proved disappointing to some of the activists who want Biden to embrace changes that would allow new legislation in Congress.
“Supporters of democracy will continue to organize and advocate, but we cannot organize our way out of this threat. It is up to our elected officials to hear supporters and act to protect our democracy,” said Wade Henderson, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, after Biden’s speech.
Asked on his way out of the venue why he did not raise the filibuster, Biden told reporters only: “I’m not filibustering now.”
He began his speech by recounting the stories of Americans who voted in the last election, lauding them for their efforts to cast their ballots amid the Covid-19 pandemic. He noted the 2020 contest had the most votes cast in any election in American history.
But he quickly turned his focus to the attacks on the 2020 election process, calling it the most scrutinized in American history. He alluded to Trump’s complaints about the election results, saying those who would deny the election result are simply denying facts.
“The Big Lie is just that: A big lie,” Biden said.
Since the November election, state lawmakers have enacted 28 laws in 17 states that restrict ballot access, according to a June tally by the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law.
Biden decried Republican obstruction to a sweeping election reform bill that Democrats argue is a necessary counter to state-level efforts to restrict voting access. The President stressed that he would work to pass that legislation, the For the People Act, as well as the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.
RELATED: Seventeen states have enacted 28 new laws making it harder to vote
But he seemed to quietly acknowledge the low likelihood that either bill becomes law, saying instead he would “engage in an all-out effort” to educate Americans about laws limiting voting across the country.
In recent days, the eyes of voting rights advocates have been fixed on Texas, where GOP lawmakers are mounting another push for restrictive voting laws during a 30-day special legislative session that Republican Gov. Greg Abbott says he wants to see focused in part on “election integrity.” Texas Democratic lawmakers have fled the state in an attempt to deny the special session a quorum, which would prevent any new laws from being passed.
Vice President Kamala Harris, who Biden has tasked with leading the administration’s voting right efforts, planned to meet with the Texas Democrats later Tuesday.
The President and his team had repeatedly previewed a major push on voting rights after Republicans in the US Senate blocked a sweeping election reform bill last month, but it remains unclear how much he can accomplish.
Passing new voting legislation in Congress will almost certainly require altering filibuster rules, since Democrats’ slim majority in the Senate isn’t enough to overcome GOP opposition – and it’s not clear Democrat have the votes to pass a bill anyway.
And Biden has said his efforts must go beyond simply limiting dark money in politics or making Election Day a federal holiday – two items included in the major bill blocked by Republicans last month. He said in June that Democratic efforts must expand to limit the ability of election boards to toss out results or replace officials based on ideology.
RELATED: Biden administration spotlights voting rights as advocates push the President to do more
Civil rights advocates have pushed the President to do more, and one – the Rev. Al Sharpton – told CNN after the speech that Biden was non-committal when Sharpton asked about his stance on the filibuster.
“He said, ‘We’re working through, Rev, where we are going to be there.’ He didn’t commit Thursday or today, but that’s what he and I talked about. I waited to bring that up to him,” Sharpton said.
Additional pressure on Biden to act came earlier this month when a Supreme Court decision limited the ability of minorities to challenge state laws they say are discriminatory under the Voting Rights Act.
The high court upheld two provisions of an Arizona voting law. The first provision says in-person ballots cast at the wrong precinct on Election Day must be wholly discarded. Another provision restricts a practice known as “ballot collection,” requiring that only family caregivers, mail carriers and election officials can deliver another person’s completed ballot to a polling place.

When President Joe Biden passingly said in a voting rights speech last week that he had been “arrested” in the context of the civil rights movement – even suggesting this had happened more than once – it was a classic Biden false claim: an anecdote about his past for which there is no evidence, prompted by a decision to ad-lib rather than stick to a prepared text, resulting in easily avoidable questions about his honesty.
Biden’s imaginary or embellished stories about his own history were the most memorable falsehoods of his first year in office. They were not, however, the only ones.
The President also made multiple false claims about important policy matters, notably including three subjects that occupied much of his time: the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, the economy and the Covid-19 pandemic.
And Biden was incorrect on numerous occasions when ad-libbing about a wide assortment of facts and figures – sometimes in a way that appeared inadvertent, but other times in a way that helped him make a political point.
Unlike his uniquely dishonest predecessor, Biden did not bury fact-checkers in a daily avalanche of serial falseness. Biden never came close to making a dozen false claims in a single speech, let alone five dozen false claims in one address, as Trump once did. In fact, the total number of Biden false claims so far is in the dozens, while Trump delivered well over 1,000 total false claims in his own first year and more than 3,000 the next year.
So Biden is no Trump. With that said, dozens of false claims from the President of the United States is not nothing. And considering that Biden added dozens more claims that were misleading or lacking in important context, he provided more than enough material to keep fact-checkers on their toes.
Here is a roundup of Biden’s first year in inaccuracy. The White House declined to comment for this article; it has previously commented for individual fact checks on some of the false claims we are discussing again below.
False claims about his own past
Biden made a series of claims about his own past that were just not true. It was these easy-to-understand, hard-to-defend personal falsehoods – more than his false claims about complex policy issues or obscure statistics, which supporters could more easily dismiss as good-faith errors – that provided the best ammunition for opponents looking to portray him as deceptive.
And like some of Trump’s tall tales about his past, Biden’s tended to be peripheral to his message. In other words, he was hurting his reputation for little possible gain.
While talking in November to technical college students standing near a truck, Biden claimed, “I used to drive a tractor-trailer,” though only for “part of a summer.” This was similar to something he had said at a Mack Trucks facility in July, when he claimed, “I used to drive an 18-wheeler, man,” adding, “I got to.” There is no evidence Biden ever drove a big truck; the White House previously noted to CNN that he once had a job driving a school bus (which is not an 18-wheeler or a tractor-trailer) and that, as a senator in 1973, he spent a night riding in a cargo truck (not driving it).
Biden repeatedly told a story about a supposed conversation during his vice presidency with an old friend, an Amtrak train conductor, that could not possibly have happened because the man was dead at the time. He repeatedly boasted that he had traveled “17,000 miles” with Chinese President Xi Jinping, though that number is not even close to correct.
Biden distracted from his voting rights message with the baseless claim last week, which he had made before, about having been arrested during a civil rights protest; in some of the previous versions of the story, he had merely claimed a police officer had taken him home from a protest. (There is evidence Biden participated in some civil rights activities in his youth but no record of any arrest.)
And Biden told two different inaccurate stories while trying to emphasize his connection to the Jewish community.
At a September event in honor of the High Holy Days, Biden told Jewish leaders that he remembered “spending time at” and “going to” Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue, the site of an antisemitic massacre in 2018; he had spoken by phone to the synagogue’s rabbi in 2019 but never went. At a Hanukkah event in December, Biden claimed that late Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir had invited him to meet with her during the Six-Day War of 1967 (he actually met with her weeks before the Yom Kippur War six years later) and, more significantly, that she had wanted him to be “the liaison between she and the Egyptians about the Suez, and so on and so forth.”
There is zero evidence Meir ever wanted to use a 30-year-old rookie US senator as a “liaison” with a major adversary.
False claims about Afghanistan
Biden was bedeviled over the summer by his chaotic withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. And he made a variety of false claims as he tried to defend his handling of the situation – further undermining his authority on an issue on which he was already struggling to persuade the public.
In August, the President said, “What interest do we have in Afghanistan at this point, with al Qaeda gone?” Al Qaeda had been degraded in Afghanistan, but it wasn’t “gone” – as a Pentagon spokesman acknowledged on camera that same day. In an interview that week, Biden defended the US withdrawal in part by claiming that the concept of nation-building in Afghanistan “never made any sense to me” – though, in fact, he had explicitly advocated nation-building in the early years of the war, both in Afghanistan and more broadly.
In July, when Biden was under pressure to quickly relocate Afghans who had assisted US troops, he said “the law doesn’t allow” Afghan translators to come to the US to await the processing of their visa applications. But experts in immigration law immediately said this wasn’t true, given the administration’s authority to grant “parole,” and, indeed, the Biden administration ended up using parole later in the summer to do what Biden had claimed wasn’t permitted.
In December, Biden said in another interview that “I’ve been against that war in Afghanistan from the very beginning.” While he eventually grew opposed to the war, he was not against it from the start – as fact-checkers pointed out when he had made similar remarks during his presidential campaign.
False claims about the economy
The state of the economy was a key rhetorical battleground between Biden and his critics: He argued it was thriving; they argued it was failing. And although both sides often cited valid data points, the President also made some false claims to bolster his case.
Biden occasionally overstated progress and understated problems. Asked at a CNN town hall in July about inflation in automobile prices, he claimed that the cost of a car was “kind of back to what it was before the pandemic”; the cost had actually increased substantially since late 2019 and early 2020. In an economic speech in November, he greatly exaggerated the extent of the decline in the unemployment rate during his tenure.
To try to sell his economic policies, Biden sometimes made inaccurate statements about what experts had said about them. In May alone, he falsely claimed that there was a consensus among economists about how many jobs his American Jobs Plan would create, significantly overstated how many jobs the firm Moody’s Analytics in particular predicted the plan would create and falsely claimed that the last five leaders of the Federal Reserve had said the plan would produce economic growth – wrongly describing both the contents and the authorship of an article that was actually written by five former Internal Revenue Service chiefs.
Later in the year, Biden misleadingly framed another Moody’s jobs estimate. And he repeatedly omitted the key phrase “longer-term” from an assertion by Nobel-winning economists that his $1.9 trillion Build Back Better agenda would “ease longer-term inflationary pressures” – leaving Americans to believe that these economists might have said his agenda would reduce the inflation hurting their bank accounts today.
False claims about the Covid-19 pandemic
Many of Biden’s first-year speeches were devoted to the Covid-19 pandemic. Biden was almost incomparably more accurate on this subject than Trump was, tending to factually convey the severity of the situation rather than match his predecessor’s fantastical rhetoric about how bad numbers were not actually bad numbers and how the virus would just disappear.
But Biden made a smattering of false claims on this topic, too.
At the CNN town hall in July, Biden made the inaccurate categorical promise that “you’re not going to get Covid” if you’re vaccinated. It was clear even before the emergence of the Omicron variant that vaccinated people were still getting infected with the virus, though the vaccines made them much less likely to get seriously ill; vaccinated people on the President’s own staff had been infected. Biden also went too far at the town hall when he categorically pledged that “if you’re vaccinated, you’re not going to be hospitalized, you’re not going to be in the ICU unit and you’re not going to die”; these outcomes happen, too, though they are much less common among vaccinated people.
Biden sometimes exaggerated on the subject of his administration’s work to get Americans vaccinated – misleadingly playing down the Trump administration’s own vaccine purchases and, in May, overstating how the US vaccination rate compared with those of the rest of the world. And he made various errors in discussing pandemic-related facts and figures.
In February, Biden claimed that “suicides are up” amid the pandemic; experts said at the time that the claim was premature, and it turned out to be wrong (though suicide rates did increase for some specific demographic groups). In October, the President wrongly told Americans that there were “over 800,000” vaccination sites in the country; he had added an extra 0 to the correct figure he usually used, 80,000.
False claims in unscripted settings
When Biden stuck to prepared speeches vetted by his staff, he tended to be factual (though certainly wasn’t perfect). When he ad-libbed or participated in unscripted exchanges with journalists and citizens, he was more likely to sprinkle in inaccuracies – making false or misleading claims about everything from his handling of the situation at the southern border to Virginia political history to gun laws to the size of a tax break for people who own racehorses.
During Biden’s first 100 days in the Oval Office, he was repeatedly incorrect or misleading in describing the actions of the Trump administration.
And he made one particularly notable misleading claim during that early period. At a heated moment of the national debate over Georgia Republicans’ new elections law, Biden did a television interview in which he criticized the law in part by misstating what it says.",2022-01-20 12:00:17

President Joe Biden on Thursday slammed a slew of Republican efforts to suppress the vote as “un-American” as Georgia’s state House and Senate passed a sweeping bill that would vastly limit access to the ballot.
The President, in his first formal news conference since taking office, criticized Republican efforts in multiple states to make it more difficult to vote before and on Election Day. The measures were introduced following former President Donald Trump’s lies about a stolen election last November, a strategy Biden described as the “most pernicious thing.”
“What I’m worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It’s sick. It’s sick,” Biden said.
The President argued that even Republican voters find measures being adopted in many states, including Texas and Arizona as well as Georgia, unacceptable and “despicable.”
“I’m not talking about the election officials – I’m talking about voters. Voters,” Biden said in an impassioned reply to a question about the voting rights issue.
The President said that he was trying to figure out how to pass a massive voting rights bill sent to the US Senate by the House. Several Democrats have expressed disquiet about parts of the bill, which Republicans have branded as an unconstitutional power grab by congressional Democrats.
Biden said that he believed current laws being introduced by Republican state legislators to limit voting access and hours were worse than the Jim Crow-era laws that institutionalized racism.
Amid questions about whether he will eventually relent in his opposition to abolishing the Senate filibuster, which requires 60 votes for major legislation and would make passing the voting rights bill impossible, Biden said he had a plan but would not reveal what it was.
“I’m not going to lay out a strategy in front of the whole world and you now,” Biden told reporters.
After Biden spoke, the Republican-led Georgia Senate approved the version of a sweeping election overhaul bill that the GOP-led House had passed earlier in the day. The legislation then headed to GOP Gov. Brian Kemp, who signed it Thursday evening, enacting faster-than-expected changes that would restrict voter access in a state that was pivotal in giving Democrats control of the White House and US Senate this year.
The legislation would limit ballot drop boxes to inside early voting locations during voting hours, make giving food or drinks to a voter a misdemeanor, allow for unlimited challenges to voter registrations and eligibility, and grant state officials broad rights, including the ability to replace local election officials. It would also shorten the runoff cycle from the current nine weeks to just four weeks and remove the elected secretary of state as chair of the state election board.
By late Thursday, three voting rights groups had already filed a suit challenging the new law.
Texas, Arizona and a clutch of others states are moving to curtail voting access – especially in big cities disproportionately favorable to Democrats.
This story has been updated with Georgia’s governor signing the bill and a lawsuit being filed to challenge it.",2021-03-25 18:22:50

President Joe Biden was not making a “human” comparison between opponents of pending voting rights bills and historical racists and segregationists in his address in Atlanta this week, the White House says.
In his speech calling for new voter protections, Biden asked whether lawmakers wanted “to be the side of Dr. King or George Wallace,” “John Lewis or Bull Connor” or “Abraham Lincoln or Jefferson Davis.”
The comparison generated some blowback afterward, but press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden was not drawing a personal link between current lawmakers and notorious southern segregationists and the president of the Confederacy.
“I think everybody listening to that speech who’s speaking on the level, as my mother would say, would note that he was not comparing them as humans, he was comparing the choice to those figures in history and where they’re going to position themselves as they determine whether they’re going to support the fundamental right to vote or not,” she said Friday.
Pressed about the comparisons on Wednesday, Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin acknowledged the language pushed the envelope.
“Perhaps the President went a little too far in his rhetoric,” Durbin told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “Some of us do.”
Other Democrats said they thought the lines – written with the help of presidential historian Jon Meacham, according to a person familiar with the matter – may have gone over Americans’ heads.
“Nobody knows who Bull Connor is,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at a news conference. “You know, if we’re making the case to say, ‘We’re going to be with Martin Luther King or Bull Connor’ – who’s that?”
On Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris defended the comparisons Thursday, calling them “apt.”
“President Biden took the, I believe, right and courageous step to say that Senate rules should not get in the way of protecting the American people’s access to the ballot. And he compared this time to a previous time in our history, which is apt for comparison,” she said.",2022-01-14 17:59:52

Young voters played a critical role in delivering Joe Biden to the White House in 2020. But as his reelection campaign kicks off, leading activists are uneasy about vouching for the president and concerned the administration could squander years of momentum
In 2020, Biden’s campaign aggressively courted younger, progressive voters as part of a strategy to fire up the grassroots and bridge the divisions that roiled the party in the run-up to Donald Trump’s election in 2016.
More than three years later, though, the relationship between the White House and young organizers is at a crossroads. The president and congressional Democrats have delivered on many notable promises but fallen short on others – a frustrating reality that has contributed to Biden’s plunging approval ratings with 18- to 29-year-olds.
The administration’s recent decision to approve a controversial Alaskan drilling project outraged young climate activists whose work on the last campaign was vital in establishing trust – and even excitement – about a Biden presidency. The White House pushed back, arguing that its legal options were constrained because the project had already been greenlit by the Trump administration. But the controversy has contributed to a resurfacing of old suspicions across aligned youth voter groups. Their leaders expressed concerns that Biden and senior aides appear increasingly determined to own the political center, even at the cost of alienating this increasingly powerful voting bloc. Young voters have turned out in record numbers in recent elections and proven their mettle as organizers by establishing a vast web of interconnected groups, with focuses on climate, immigration, gun violence, student debt, health care, LGBTQ rights and more.
“It’s a hard sell to us ourselves. If your own activists, the people who are supposed to be convincing other people, are wondering, ‘Are we convinced at all whether he’s doing a great job or not?,’ then how are we supposed to go out and convince other people?” said Noah Lumbantobing, from the anti-gun-violence group March for Our Lives. “Biden has done good things. He hasn’t done enough in terms of using his bully pulpit.”
In more than a dozen interviews with organizers from leading youth groups, front-line activists, and young Democratic strategists and legislative aides, a portrait emerges of a hyper-engaged and idealistic generation that, in a break from the past, has become remarkably savvy about how to wield its power. Forged during Trump’s presidency and the Covid-19 pandemic, they are ardent opponents of the right’s political and cultural agenda – a reality that could ultimately prevail over disappointment with Biden – but also determined to make leading Democrats, many of them five or six decades older, earn their support.
A number of them, who asked to remain anonymous to protect relationships inside the administration, said the Biden team is accessible and proactive in asking for their input. But they said that the interactions can often feel perfunctory and their suggestions are largely ignored.
“We don’t need help being convinced that the Republicans are the bad guys, and we need to fight against them,” said Michele Weindling, electoral director for the Sunrise Movement, a youth-led climate group. “We need to be told not just why we’re voting against the right, but what we’re voting for.”
Biden campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz noted the spike in youth voter turnout during the 2020 election and said the campaign would “work hard to earn every Americans’ vote by using innovative ways to reach them, and highlighting the stakes of this election.”
“There’s only one candidate in this race who is fighting – and delivering – on (the most important issues to young voters),” Munoz added. “And it’s President Biden.”
Biden this week also received an endorsement from the progressive group NextGen, a leading youth voter turnout organization. NextGen PAC President Cristina Tzintzún Ramirez said in a statement, “It is clear that Biden is not only listening to us, but is taking robust action to signal to young people across the country that unprecedented change is possible.”
Youth vote on the rise
For generations, Democrats have talked up the electoral power of young voters. When the voting age was lowered to 18 from 21 ahead of the 1972 elections, many liberals expected the new electorate to break strongly to the left. But the statistics told a different story. Youth turnout tended to be middling and younger Americans were not, as so many predicted, dramatically more liberal than their parents – at least in the voting booth.
That dynamic, though, has changed in recent elections. Young voters today are more liberal than their parents and increasingly likely to vote that way. By the fall of 2024, experts predict Gen-Z and Millennials – a range roughly spanning those older than 18 but younger than 45 – will make up 40% of the vote-share. And with older voters, from Generation X to the Baby Boomers, more consistently choosing conservative candidates, there is an increasing onus on Democrats to dig in harder on issues that resonate most with younger Americans.
The Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee are investing early in efforts to reach those voters. A campaign official told CNN that they held a call with social media influencer managers last week after the announcement. The DNC, a spokesperson said, has begun a partnership with gun violence prevention groups “on a training series to engage young voters in schools and on campuses.”
John Della Volpe, the polling director at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics and the author of “Fight: How Gen Z Is Channeling Their Fear and Passion to Save America,” said Biden is better off with young voters now than at a similar stage of the campaign four years ago, but he is currently not as strong as he was by Election Day.
“We started that summer of 2020 kind of where we are now, which is with a lot of young people questioning,” said Della Volpe, who took leave that year to advise the Biden campaign. “But I was always incredibly confident that young people would respond to not just to his message, but his values and vision.”
The challenge for Biden this time around, he added, will be in convincingly informing and selling young voters on Democrats’ accomplishments – including the massive green investments in the Inflation Reduction Act and executive efforts to cancel up to $400 billion in student debt.
There is also a psychic hurdle that needs clearing, Della Volpe said, for a generation that has only known dysfunction and division in Washington and across the federal government.
“The other piece that’s unique about talking to younger people is you can’t assume that they have the trust in the system that it’s ever worked,” he said. “You need to do two or three steps with this demographic group, where in other groups who’ve got a stronger connection with government and elections, maybe you can do it in one or two steps.”
Last week, Della Volpe and five students from the Harvard Youth Poll visited Washington to brief senior advisers to Biden and staff on the issues that young people care about, a tradition of sorts that began during the Obama administration.
Perhaps the clearest opportunity for Biden to juice support with young and first-time voters, advocates agreed, was on the issue of abortion. Turnout among the 18-to-29 set came in at about 27% in 2022, according to Tufts University’s CIRCLE, the second highest rate for a midterm election after 2018, when the number crossed 30%. That vote came months after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and as abortion was on the ballot across several states. Last month in Wisconsin, young voters played a key role in electing a liberal state Supreme Court judge who, with the court’s new left-leaning majority, is expected to strike down Wisconsin’s abortion ban.
Teddy Landis, the 25-year-old director of Project 72 WI, helped lead on-campus organizing ahead of the April election. His efforts won national attention after Judge Janet Protasiewicz outperformed recently reelected Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ share of the vote on campus, according to the group’s stats. The main driver, he said, was concern over abortion – especially in a state where it’s been outlawed.
“In the fall, the election was an election about abortion. And then in the spring, we have an election, which is an election about abortion. And so I was concerned that if this is all we talk about, people are going to feel sick of it,” Landis said. “The reality was people are not sick about talking about abortion and it does really matter to them.”
That dynamic, he added with a note of regret, will likely become even more pronounced over the coming months as more young voters feel the effects of anti-abortion laws.
Republicans’ parallel efforts to pass legislation aimed at transgender youth is creating a similar dynamic – genuine sorrow and anger at the real-life consequences, but also a realization that the GOP might be overstepping, and creating new political opportunities for Democrats.
More than 400 anti-trans bills have been introduced in state legislatures this year, including many that would forbid gender-affirming care for minors, ban certain books and prohibit teachers from discussing certain subject matter in the classroom. Nearly all the 2024 Republican primary candidates are using anti-trans rhetoric and suggesting support for new federal legislation.
Trump has described gender-affirming surgery for minors as “child sexual mutilation,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has pushed a series of measures that would make it more difficult for trans people to receive health care and, last week, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley mocked and misgendered Dylan Mulvaney, a transgender woman and social media influencer, calling her “a guy dressing up like a girl making fun of women.”
Biden has spoken out forcefully against Republican efforts to limit the rights of transgender youth at the state level. His administration is also seeking a federal rule change that would block policies that “categorically” bar trans students from participating on sports teams consistent with their gender. The push, though, would allow for schools to place some restrictions on those athletes – a provision that was met with pushback from advocacy groups.
“There’s one side that is trying to take away our rights, and there’s another side that has completely squandered any opportunity to enshrine our rights,” said non-binary activist Esmée Silverman, the co-founder of Queer Youth Assemble. Silverman also criticized the White House and Democrats for not parlaying its two-year governing trifecta on Capitol Hill – now gone after Republicans won the House in the midterms – into a “a single piece of long-term solution” for transgender people.
Biden has also been a frequent advocate for the Equality Act, a federal bill to prohibit discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity in nearly all aspects of American life. The legislation, however, is mired in a divided Congress. In June 2022, he signed an executive order directing the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services to broaden access to gender-affirming care and counter, to the extent possible, the rising tide of anti-trans legislation in the states.
“My message to all the young people: Just be you,” Biden said at the signing. “You are loved. You are heard. You are understood. You do belong.”
Landis, the campus organizer, said the GOP attacks would backfire politically and that Biden has a major opportunity to win over skeptical young voters by not shying away from future criticism.
“Young voters are pretty likely to know someone who is trans or identifies as non-binary,” he said. “And so when they see these extremist Republicans talk about people they know in these crazy ways, that does a lot to repel them from the idea that they could even be someone that they would vote for one day.”
A turn to the center?
Backlash to Biden’s recent actions on climate and immigration has been increasingly pointed.
The young activists from Climate Defiance, another youth-led group, made headlines recently by interrupting a speech by White House senior adviser John Podesta. Days later, they disrupted entry to the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner while demanding the president honor his pledge to stop fossil fuel extraction on public land.
Tennessee state Rep. Justin Jones, the 27-year-old Democrat who was voted out of the body over a gun violence protest on its floor before the Nashville Metropolitan Council reinstated him, spoke at the weekend protest.
“I wanted to come out here and stand with you all,” Jones said through a bullhorn. “We are going to continue to push the fight and stay with the people because we know our generation is dealing with the long-term implications of these decisions.”
Another young activist with a large social media following told CNN that they believe “the administration is listening,” but that the Willow Project, a massive oil drilling project on Alaska’s North Slope, and other expansions of the fossil fuel economy undermine other, substantial achievements.
“I appreciate all those efforts,” the activist said, “but if you approve the Driftwood Pipeline in Louisiana, if you approve exports for the Alaska LNG projects, if you approve two LNG projects in Texas, how are young people expected to see that you’re listening to us when you continue to approve projects similar to Willow?”
Young immigrants’ rights activists are particularly sour on Biden’s tenure. That troubled relationship came to the fore during the 2020 primary and remains in flux. The administration’s actions on asylum restrictions and the treatment of migrants at the border has stoked further distrust.
Michelle Ming, the political director for United We Dream, praised Biden for extending access to the Affordable Care Act to participants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, the Obama-era program that allows undocumented immigrants who came to the US under age 16 to apply for protection from deportation.
But that move, she said, has been a lonely highlight for activists who believe Biden could more aggressively use his executive power to expand DACA and further grow eligibility for immigrants seeking Temporary Protected Status, which applies to people who would face extreme hardship if forced to return to their homelands.
“I don’t think immigration has been his strong suit, to put it very nicely,” Ming said. “He has definitely not been as bold as we would like him to be on immigration. That’s not just a him problem, it’s a problem with the Democrats as a whole.”
Like so many other organizers, Ming said the prospect of any potential Republican nominee being elected would ultimately be reason enough to vote for the president. But convincing others, she added, is getting increasingly difficult.
“We first of all have to be honest, because young people detect bullsh*t really easily and they hate that,” Ming said. “He has not been as progressive as we’ve wanted him to be. But he’s also not a fascist, a White supremacist, or a blatant racist.”
The seething antipathy toward Republicans, especially in the party’s MAGA camp, might ultimately be sufficient to assure Biden the continued support in the voting booth – if not the polls – that his reelection campaign needs.
“Gen Z recognizes that, although the Biden-Harris administration and our federal government at large has a lot of work to do, and there’s still a lot of work that our generation and the generations after us have, it’s better than Trump,” said Haley Taylor Schlitz, a 20-year-old Democrat and candidate for school board in a Fort Worth, Texas, area suburb. “Let’s just start there.”
Billy Honor, the director of organizing for the New Georgia Project Action Fund, told CNN he’s more excited about upcoming local races in battleground states than the presidential contest. When facing disillusioned voters when he’s knocking doors, his argument tends to be more holistic.
“It is more about the process,” Honor says, “than it is about the candidates themselves.”
Then there is the math. For Biden, he said, the equation is actually pretty simple.
“You don’t need a mass movement. … You just need a really good, really good number,” Honor said. “And I do think that that’s possible, even in a climate where you’re not going to have college students who are excited for Joe Biden like they were for Barack Obama.”",2023-05-04 11:01:41

Just weeks before the 2020 election, Michigan Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib pressed undecided voters in Michigan to throw their support behind Joe Biden.
In a virtual rally alongside other lawmakers, the first Palestinian American woman to serve in Congress was clear in her enthusiasm for Biden, arguing that he would create a better future for Americans.
“This election … has to be a huge turnout, one that for me has to speak volumes. People say your vote is your voice; well, I want the voice to be a bullhorn,” she said, adding, “I want it to be so loud and so echoey that people understand exactly what we all believe in, which is, we believe that government must be about people.”
More than three years later, the silence from Tlaib and other Muslim leaders on the president’s 2024 reelection bid is speaking volumes as Biden continues to back Israel in its war against Hamas in Gaza.
Tlaib – a liberal firebrand who represents parts of Detroit and its suburbs – accused the president in November of supporting a Palestinian “genocide,” straining her relationship with Biden. Her office declined multiple requests for comment on whether she would support the president in his reelection bid.
The distance between Tlaib and the White House is reflective of the work Biden must do to repair the relationship with a key part of his coalition. Many Arab Americans and Muslim voters who have spoken to CNN say they will not support Biden’s reelection efforts due to his unwavering support of Israel and failure to call for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. But the problems go beyond that – Democratic strategists who spoke to CNN are warning that the president may struggle to find surrogates willing to take on the task of speaking to key voter groups such as Muslims, Arab Americans and angered progressives.
The administration appears to be struggling with finding Arab American and Muslim leaders who are willing to even meet with White House officials, and no Muslim or Arab American groups have endorsed Biden’s reelection bid.
But multiple local leaders declined invitations to meet with Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Biden’s campaign manager. Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud, the city’s first Arab American and Muslim mayor who represents one of the country’s largest Muslim populations, told CNN Friday that he declined the meeting because “this is not a time for electoral politics” and that a conversation about change would be “with policymakers. Not campaign staff.”
“If President Biden would want to come and have a real conversation about how he changes course, about his actions, decisions that he’s made overseas upon calling for an immediate ceasefire, we can entertain such a conversation and sit down,” Hammoud told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “The Source.”
In a previous interview with CNN, Hammoud said he would be willing to meet with the president if there was a “an opportunity to have a real constructive dialogue about how we move forward.”
“But if it’s just an opportunity to take pictures and to say that ‘we listened,’ but nothing is changing, then it’s not a table worth sitting at,” he told CNN.
A White House spokesperson told CNN its officials have “had more than 100 conversations with leaders at the local and state level concerning the conflict and humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza.”
In addition, the spokesperson added that the White House offices of Intergovernmental Affairs and Public Engagement have consistently engaged with community leaders and elected officials since the October 7 attacks.
Recently, a staffer in Vice President Kamala Harris’ office reached out to a prominent figure within the Arab American community in Michigan to see whether they would meet with Harris as the vice president wanted to speak with community leaders, according to a person familiar with these conversations.
The individual declined the request, stating the administration has continued to “ignore” Arab Americans following the October 7 attack, the person said. Harris’ office said in a statement to CNN that “the President and Vice President have made it a priority to hear directly from Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim communities of America on the conflict in Gaza.”
“(Harris) has also spoken to Hanan Shaheen, the mother of Wadee Alfayoumi, the 6-year-old Palestinian-American who was killed in October in Illinois. The President and Vice President will continue to listen and engage directly with these communities,” the statement said.
Discord becoming all too apparent
Biden has not been able to ignore the discord within his own party as he attempts to turn the page to a general election campaign, as cries of “Genocide Joe” and “ceasefire now” follow him around the campaign trail.
Democratic strategist Adrian Hemond said the president should be concerned about the lack of support he is getting among these communities, particularly in Michigan, which is home to more than 200,000 Muslim American voters.
“He’s got a little bit of a political tightrope to walk right now,” said Hemond, who is based in Michigan. “A lot of them are going to respond by staying home because they think both their options are bad. And I think that’s a pretty good descriptor of Arab American voters right now.”
The ceasefire calls are coming from a diversity of progressive groups, including those representing Jewish voters, voters of color and young people – key parts of Biden’s winning 2020 coalition.
Chavez Rodriguez’s Michigan meetings, the source familiar said, are part of a routine dialogue with constituency groups and “have been in the works for several weeks” as the Biden campaign looks to engage with grassroots leaders.
Assad Turfe, a deputy Wayne County executive, said the campaign was in touch with him about three weeks ago to gauge the community’s feelings. The campaign reached out again this week and asked whether he’d help organize a meeting with members of the community and Chavez Rodriguez for Friday.
He was working toward assembling a meeting of 10 to 15 members of the Arab American and Muslim community, including some local elected officials, for Friday afternoon, but they ultimately decided not to move forward.
“I gauged the pulse of the community, and the war in Gaza’s been going on for 111 days. There’s 30,000 dead people. Fifty percent of the population is living in hunger. There’s no functioning hospitals and ultimately there’s been 111 days to able to call for a ceasefire,” he said. “At the end of the day, people look at us as leaders, and we’ve got to make a leadership decision and we’ve got to do what’s in the best interest of our community.”
Osama Siblani, a Dearborn community leader and publisher of the Arab American News, was among those who did meet with Chavez Rodriguez on Friday morning, calling the 90-minute conversation “direct and frank.”
“I looked her in the eyes and told her how I and my community feel about Biden,” said Siblani, who is Lebanese American.
Potential backers stay silent
The White House has tried to quell criticism of the president’s handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict by holding listening sessions for groups from inside and outside of the government. It also deployed Dilawar Syed – the deputy administrator of the US Small Business Administration who is one of the highest-ranking Muslim officials in the Biden administration – to a vigil for the 6-year-old Palestinian American boy, stabbed to death because he was Muslim.
But those efforts have failed to quell frustrations among sections of Biden’s 2020 coalition.
“To discount the anger from Arab voters, Muslim voters and voters of color across the country who also overwhelmingly support a ceasefire is discounting core parts of (Biden’s) base and the core base of the Democratic Party that has – election after election – elected Democrats and served as the reason Democrats beat Republicans in every campaign cycle that they do,” said Usamah Andrabi, the communications director for Justice Democrats, a progressive grassroots organization.
In the last presidential election cycle, Biden received the support of several prominent Muslim American elected officials and community leaders. But this time around, many are skeptical – and angry.
“I believe he is beyond redemption,” said Khalid Turaani, 57, a consultant based in Michigan and co-chair of the state’s chapter of the Abandon Biden movement. “I will not vote for Joe Biden. I believe that his complicity and his active participation in the genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza disqualify him from my vote.”
“I just feel very, very angry that I voted for such a person that would enable such atrocities,” said Farah Khan, an IT specialist in Northville, Michigan.
At least 146,620 of the 200,000 Muslim American voters in Michigan cast a ballot in the 2020 election cycle, according to an analysis by Emgage. In 2020, Biden won Michigan by three percentage points over Trump. Four years prior, Trump won the state over Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton by 0.2 percentage points.
Muslim leaders within the Abandon Biden movement, a national campaign working against Biden’s reelection efforts, say they operate in crucial swing states such as Michigan, Minnesota, Florida, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania to get voters not to support Biden.
Nabila Taha, a Pennsylvania resident who spoke at an Abandon Biden news conference in Washington, DC, this month, said she would do everything possible to ensure Biden will not win in 2024.
“We will go knocking on every door … telling them the story of the billions that they are sending over to kill our brothers and sisters instead of spending it here on our schools, while our senior citizens are fighting to choose between eating or paying for medications,” Taha said.
Abandoning the president
The Abandon Biden campaign was created in Minnesota after a group of Muslim Americans demanded the president call for a ceasefire by October 31. And when Biden didn’t respond to these calls to support a permanent halt in fighting, the group vowed to campaign against him.
When a reporter asked Biden whether he were concerned about Arab American voters who said they would not support him, he responded, “The former president wants to put a ban on Arabs coming into the country. … We understand who cares about the Arab population.”
Michael Tyler, the Biden campaign’s communications director, told reporters on Wednesday that the president will “continue to engage in conversations with the Arab American community.”
“We believe that it’s important to have consistent conversations with folks, even when they disagree with you on a policy position,” he said.
But it is still unclear whether Biden or Harris plans to visit Michigan or other states to engage with Arab American and Muslim voters specifically. Some Arab American and Muslim voters say even if Biden’s campaign ramps up their outreach, it will be too late.
“I feel used as a Muslim voter,” said Ariana Afshar, 27, a content creator based in California. “He used people like myself in order to get elected and is now doing whatever serves him in his position.”
“Outreach will not work here,” said Hassan Abdel Salam, a human rights professor at the University of Minnesota and co-founder of the Abandon Biden campaign. “When you conduct this type of campaign of death, and it lasts over 100 days, there is no way that any outreach can reverse the decisions they’ve done.”
“There is no possibility of repair while he is supporting an act of genocide. So, there is no reason to have communication,” said Dawud Walid, the executive director of the Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.
Some Michigan voters told CNN that they would rather support a third-party candidate or Trump if it means Biden will lose in 2024.
“If it’s neck and neck, and in order to get Biden to lose it will require me to vote for Trump, then absolutely I will do that. I will do exactly that,” said Samraa Luqman, 41, a real estate agent who did not vote for Biden or Trump in the last presidential election cycle.
She added: “I never in my life thought I would say that. … They have really screwed up this time.”

Mr. Biden did not go so far as to call for full-scale elimination of the filibuster, but said he supported an exception in the case of voting rights legislation.
WASHINGTON — President Biden endorsed changing Senate rules to pass new voting rights legislation during a speech in Atlanta on Tuesday, warning of a grave threat to American democracy if lawmakers did not act to “protect the heart and soul” of the country.
Mr. Biden did not go so far as to call for full-scale elimination of the filibuster, a Senate tradition that allows the minority party to block legislation that fails to garner 60 votes, but said he supported “getting rid of” it in the case of voting rights legislation. Such a change in Senate procedures has only the slimmest of chances of winning the support of all 50 senators who caucus with the Democrats, which is needed to overcome universal Republican opposition.
Mr. Biden, a former senator and an institutionalist who had long been leery of whittling away at the filibuster, said such Senate traditions had been “abused.”
“Sadly, the United States Senate, designed to be the world’s greatest deliberative body, has been rendered a shell of its former self,” Mr. Biden said.
During an at-times emotional speech delivered at a consortium of four historically Black colleges and universities, Mr. Biden laid out the principles he wanted to be associated with — providing access to the ballot, fostering racial equality, and keeping “the promise of America alive” — and made it clear that, win or lose, he wanted to be on the right side of history.
“I ask every elected official in America: How do you want to be remembered?” Mr. Biden said.
“Do you want to be on the side of Dr. King or George Wallace? Do you want to be on the side of John Lewis or Bull Connor? Do you want to be on the side of Abraham Lincoln or Jefferson Davis?” he asked, drawing a sharp line between men who fought for civil rights and others who fought to deny them, comparisons that at moments drew gasps from the crowd.
Equating opponents of Senate rule changes to slaveholders and segregationists is a political gamble for Mr. Biden, whose visit to Georgia was designed to invigorate a Democratic-led effort to pass new voting rights laws in the 50-50 Senate in the coming days.
One bill introduced by Democrats, the Freedom to Vote Act, would, among other provisions, block efforts to restrict mail-in or absentee voting, make Election Day a holiday, and stop state legislators from redrawing districts in a way that activists say denies representation to minority voters. Another, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, would restore anti-discrimination components of the Voting Rights Act that were stripped away by the Supreme Court in 2013.
The reality remains: Even with Mr. Biden’s new call for a filibuster exception, changing Senate rules would require the support of the entire Democratic caucus and the vote of Vice President Kamala Harris to break a tie and pass the legislation.
Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, both Democrats, have expressed strong public opposition to changing filibuster rules. A handful of others have more quietly voiced concerns with the changes. Mr. Manchin said Tuesday that the Senate needs “some good rule changes to make the place work better, but getting rid of the filibuster doesn’t make it work better.”
Republicans, who have sought to point out that Democrats have in the past relied on the protection of the filibuster when in the minority, have been blunter with their critiques.
“There is also a reasonable chance Republicans will win both houses in Congress and that Donald Trump himself could once again be elected president in 2024,” Senator Mitt Romney, a Republican of Utah, said on the Senate floor on Tuesday. “Have Democrats thought what it would mean for them, for the Democrat minority to have no power whatsoever?”
(Of Mr. Biden comparing opponents of rules changes to segregationists, Mr. Romney added, “So much for unifying the country and working across the aisle.”)
Still, in an effort to apply pressure, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, said Republicans could have until Monday, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, to drop their opposition to debate and votes on the issue, or face the prospect of overhauling filibuster rules.

Mr. Biden traveled to Georgia with a major piece of his agenda, a large social spending plan, stalled. Pivoting to voting rights gives him a new issue to focus on, but he also risks failing to deliver on his promises.
But for the second time in two weeks, Mr. Biden went on the attack against former President Donald J. Trump, reminding Democrats of the stakes with the midterm elections ahead.
“The goal of the former president and his allies is to disenfranchise anyone who votes against them,” Mr. Biden said. “Simple as that.”
Mr. Biden’s advisers have promised that he will continue to forcefully support two voting rights bills aimed at beating back a swath of restrictive voting measures passed through Republican-led statehouses around the country.
Back in Washington, multiple proposals to find ways to appease Mr. Manchin, Ms. Sinema, and other possible holdouts are circulating, including restoring the “talking” filibuster by requiring lawmakers to take the floor, Mr. Smith-style; reducing the number of votes needed to break a filibuster; and limiting its use altogether in some circumstances.
But finding bipartisan comity this time will be all but impossible for Mr. Biden, who spent 36 years in the Senate and views himself as a consensus builder. Republicans have argued that the bills would impede the rights of states to conduct their own election, and that Democrats are using the voting rights legislation to try to gain partisan advantage.
Activists say those critics ignore glaring examples of voter suppression. Voting rights groups in Georgia have already filed a federal lawsuit that accuses legislators of redrawing a congressional district to benefit Republican candidates and deny representation to Black voters.
Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, promised a scorched-earth response should Democrats try to change the rule: “Since Senator Schumer is hellbent on trying to break the Senate, Republicans will show how this reckless action would have immediate consequences,” Mr. McConnell said in a statement on Monday.
Mr. Biden’s visit to Georgia was also intended to restore his relationship with some voting rights activists who are disappointed that he exhausted his political capital in his first year in office on other efforts, including a bipartisan infrastructure deal and a stalled social spending plan. Georgia, a state Mr. Biden won by only 11,779 votes, has seen some of the most sweeping attempts by Republicans to assert partisan power in elections, particularly through restricting mail-in, absentee or early voting.
Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris leaned heavily on the power of symbolism as he traveled to the former district of Mr. Lewis, the Georgia congressman and civil rights icon for whom the legislation is named. Mr. Lewis, a sharecropper’s son, was bloodied in the Jim Crow South as he championed racial equity and the right to vote.

The pair visited the crypt of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his wife, Coretta Scott King. They also visited the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, where both Dr. King and Mr. Lewis were eulogized. Senator Raphael Warnock, the state’s first Black senator and a Democrat who is seeking a full term this year after a runoff victory, is a senior pastor there.
Some activists offered tempered support before the president’s speech, angered by what they said was a lack of attention as state-level restrictions go into effect.
Bee Nguyen, a state representative for Georgia and Democrat candidate for secretary of state, said that she has tried to stress to the White House that activists need to hear more than encouragement to simply out-organize voter suppression, one of the strategies Biden administration officials have encouraged in their engagement with activists.
“The burden should not be on the shoulders of Black and brown Georgians to simply exercise the right to vote,” Ms. Nguyen said. “If we can’t get this done it’s going to be really difficult to climb out of what we’re seeing.”
Stacey Abrams, the voting rights advocate and Democratic candidate for governor in Georgia, declined to attend the speech and her campaign manager, Lauren Groh-Wargo, blamed a “conflict.” Two Democratic officials familiar with the planning said Ms. Abrams had decided not to go in part because she was not invited to give remarks. But Ms. Groh-Wargo denied that, and said in a brief interview on Tuesday evening that there had been “no discussion” of a speaking slot. The Democratic officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private conversations.
One prominent family attended the event. Martin Luther King III, the oldest living son of the civil rights leader, and his wife, Arndrea Waters King, met privately with Mr. Biden in Atlanta before the president and the King family, who have planned a series of marches to pressure Democrats to pass the legislation, visited the civil rights leader’s crypt.

During a private meeting with the president, the Kings said in an interview, they did most of the talking.
“We felt that the president cited his pedigree of deal making as a senator” while speaking about the importance of voting rights, Mrs. King said. “We know that he has the power and influence to do the same today as president. I have to say we’ll be watching closely.”
In his speech, Mr. Biden said he wants to “let the majority prevail.”
“And if that bare minimum is blocked,” he said, “we have no option but to change the Senate rules, including getting rid of the filibuster.”
Earlier in the day, Mr. Biden was on his way into the Ebenezer Baptist Church when he was asked what he would say to activists who are concerned that his embrace of changing Senate rules may be too little and too late.
“Keep the faith,” the president replied, before ducking into the church.

As Kerry Singleton looks ahead to the next presidential election, he’s thinking back to the excitement he felt when President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris visited the historic grounds of Clark Atlanta University and Morehouse College.
“I remember the energy that was here on campus that day,” said Singleton, a Morehouse senior, who stood in the crowd and applauded the speech on voting rights, democracy and more.
On that crisp winter day in January 2022, the president was closing in on his first year in office and Singleton and others in the audience had high hopes.
Since then, voting rights legislation has stalled in Congress. The Supreme Court rejected a student loan forgiveness plan. And high prices – from food to housing – are fueling economic anxieties that Singleton said have come together to dampen his enthusiasm for the possibilities of what the Biden administration could achieve.
“We’re not expecting them to make change overnight,” Singleton said in an interview this week. “But I do think that everyone is willing to hold the administration accountable for some of those promises that were made. If they don’t happen, I think it’s going to be a scary election.”
For all of the warning signs facing the president a year before the election, apathy and skepticism from young voters is high on the list. A spokesman for the Biden campaign called the election “deeply consequential for young people,” and pledged to build on a strong turnout from younger voters in the 2022 midterm elections.
Yet a respectful resistance toward the president comes alive in one conversation after another, with the deepest concerns touching on his age – he turns 81 next week – the economy and the Israel-Hamas war.
“If they can fund a war, they can find the money to pay off our student loans,” said Rachael Carroll, who cast her first vote for president for Biden. “The cost of living is way too high right now. I don’t think the economy really caters to young people.”
Carroll said she doesn’t regret her vote for Biden or Harris, particularly given the alternative of Donald Trump, but finds herself disappointed by some White House priorities.
“They made a lot of promises going into office and a lot of those have not been met,” said Carroll, who graduated last year and works for a nonprofit advocacy group. She said she intends to vote for Biden again, but worries about a lack of enthusiasm she sees among people her age.
“It is for Biden, however, it’s against Trump in the same breath,” Carroll said. “A lot of times we’re voting, unfortunately, for the lesser of two evils.”
Kevin Munoz, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, said the election would offer a stark choice and a clear contrast next November.
“We are working hard to highlight how an extreme MAGA agenda would devastate the financial security, safety, and freedom of young people,” Munoz told CNN, adding: “As Democrats did in 2020 and 2022, we will meet younger Americans where they are and earn their votes.”
Indeed, young voters were a critical component of the president’s victory – particularly here in Georgia, where Biden defeated Trump by only 11,779 votes out of nearly 5 million cast.
Exit polls in 2020 showed that voters 18 to 29 made up 20% of the Georgia electorate – the only state of the top six battlegrounds where the percentage of young voters exceeded the national share of 17%.
Then, Biden won young Georgia voters by 13 points, according to exit polls. But now, a year before the election, surveys show a far closer race, with voters under the age of 30 here split 46% for Trump and 44% for Biden, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll.
“You’ve got to vote for something,” said Georgia state Sen. Nabilah Islam Parkes, a Democrat, who organized voters in 2020 to help build Biden’s winning coalition.
“The first time around, we fired Donald Trump. This time around, if voters want to rehire Joe Biden, they want to see policies, they want to feel like the issues they’re concerned about are being heard.”
Islam Parkes, a Muslim American who last fall became the youngest woman elected to the Georgia Senate, said rebuilding that Democratic coalition has become more complicated given the anger many younger voters have expressed over the administration’s financial support for Israel in the aftermath of the October 7 massacre of Israeli civilians by Hamas terrorists.
“They don’t want to feel complicit in the funding of an ongoing war,” Islam Parkes said. “I think that young voters recognize you can’t bomb your way to peace and security.”
Aylon Gipson, a senior at Morehouse College, also recalled the excitement of seeing Biden and Harris visit campus last year. He said he intended to support Biden, but without the enthusiasm of four years ago.
“We’re going into an election cycle where we have to pick between two different people who are very, very old in age,” Gipson said. “I think that there should be other candidates that should have emerged from a Democratic primary to actually challenge Biden.”
Paul Sprowl, a classmate, said he “would like to see Biden pass the baton.” He said too many American politicians are reluctant to retire, which feeds mistrust in the system.
“My generation tries not to play into ageism, but there are some really valid concerns,” Sprowl said of Biden, who will be 82 if he wins reelection next year. (Trump would be 78 next year.) “It’s like why would you even want to work when you reach a certain age? I would be enjoying the final years of my life in peace. I think that brings a lot of mistrust.”
Christopher Lambry, a Morehouse freshman, said he was concerned at the softening of support for Biden among many younger Black voters, particularly men. He feared a disinformation campaign was at work that may have undermined Biden’s standing, but he also believed voters were eager for inspiration.
“A lot of the lack of response from younger generations,” Lambry said, “comes because we want to see that there is still hope in the glimpse of darkness.”
Some of the biggest accomplishments of the Biden administration – from infrastructure funding to the lowering of prescription drug prices – don’t resonate as loudly in interviews with younger voters. Child care, affordable housing and abortion rights were expressed as far bigger priorities.
With Biden at the top of the ticket, potentially facing a rematch of the 2020 race, young voters say the burden rests on him to deliver on his promises and stir excitement about his candidacy – not take their support for granted.
“Just as we hold Trump accountable,” said Singleton, the Morehouse senior who saw Biden early last year, “we have to hold Biden accountable.”",2023-11-15 11:00:03
https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/13/opinion/michigan-primary-biden.html,Michigan Voters’ Anger Is a Problem for Joe Biden - The New York Times,Union members and Arab voters in the state are crucial to the Democrats’ coalition.,"Betrayal is a powerful emotion, especially at the ballot box. Voters who feel betrayed tend to act like spurned lovers, punishing the offending party even if it means electing somebody who will actually be worse.
That’s how America got Donald Trump as president. Many blue-collar workers in factory towns in battleground states like Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania — who were once pillars of the Democratic Party — voted for a man who promised to rip up free trade agreements, which they blamed for the loss of manufacturing jobs. It didn’t seem to matter to them that Mr. Trump had no track record of standing up for workers or that employees at his hotels faced union-busting tactics when they tried to organize.
More important was using their votes to punish Democrats for abandoning the working class.
Joe Biden understood that, and in 2020 he set out to atone for the sins of the Democratic Party by promising to be the most pro-union president ever — a promise he has kept. It’s not just that he became the first sitting president to join a picket line. It’s not just that he appointed the most pro-union National Labor Relations Board since the 1930s, as the labor historian Jeff Schuhrke told me. It’s all the things his appointees are doing behind the scenes.",2024-02-13 10:02:29

President Joe Biden painted a dire picture for the nation’s future elections during a major speech on voting rights while in Atlanta on Tuesday, expressing his frustration at Republicans who blocked voting rights legislation and calling on the US Senate to change its filibuster rules to accommodate the bills’ passage.
“I’ve been having these quiet conversations with members of Congress for the last two months. I’m tired of being quiet,” Biden said, slamming his hand on the lectern.
The President’s speech in Atlanta, a city at the heart of the civil rights movement, is the latest in his recurring calls for the nation’s voting rights to be bolstered. Throughout the first year of his presidency, Biden has devoted several speeches to voting rights, including in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on the centenary of the race massacre in that city; South Carolina State University’s graduation ceremony; at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial in Washington and at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia.
Changing the filibuster rules in the Senate, which require 60 votes to end debate on legislation, was a major focus of the day Tuesday – and Biden’s address specifically.
Without changing the rules, it’s unclear how either bill Biden wants passed – the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act – will get done.
During the remarks, made on the grounds of Clark Atlanta University and Morehouse College, Biden called for the rules to be changed. He had previously expressed his support for making an exception to the filibuster rules in order to pass voting rights legislation but expressed more flexibility on Tuesday.
“I support changing the Senate rules, whichever way they need to be changed to prevent a minority of senators from blocking actions on voting rights,” he said.
The Senate is expected to take up voting rights in the coming days. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer set a deadline of January 17 – Martin Luther King Jr. Day – for the Senate to vote on a rules change if Republicans continue to block voting rights legislation.
Harkening back to his campaign slogan, the President told attendees in Atlanta that “the battle for the soul of America is not over” and he directly tied the passage of voting rights legislation to the January 6 insurrection.
Biden recalled “the violent mob” that stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, and former President Donald Trump, who he said “sought to win through violence what he had lost through the ballot box, to impose the will of a mob, to overturn free and fair elections, and for the first time in American history, to stop peaceful transfer of power.”
“They failed. They failed. But democracy’s victory was not certain. Nor is democracy’s future,” Biden continued.
“This is the moment to decide”
The President said he was delivering his speech in Atlanta “to stand against the forces in America that value power over principle, forces that attempted a coup, a coup against the legally expressed will of the American people by sowing doubt, inventing charges of fraud and seeking to steal the 2020 election from the people.”
Biden also voiced frustration that no Republicans have come around to supporting the voting rights legislation, suggesting it was a break from past precedent when both parties rallied behind the issue.
“The vice president and I have supported voting rights bills since day one of this administration, but each and every time Senate Republicans have blocked the way,” he said. “Republicans oppose even debating the issue. You hear me? I have been around the Senate a long time. I was vice president for eight years. I’ve never seen a circumstance where not one single Republican has a voice that’s ready to speak for justice now.”
The President recalled working with the segregationist Sen. Strom Thurmond, who he said eventually came around to supporting voting rights bills.
“Not a single Republican has displayed the courage to stand up to a defeated president to protect America’s right to vote. Not one. Not one,” Biden said.
He said the narrow majority Democrats hold in the US Senate made achieving anything more difficult but that this moment, like other consequential moments in history, provides a binary choice: Lawmakers are faced with either standing on the side of civil rights leaders like King or on the side of segregationists like former Alabama Gov. George Wallace.
“Do you want to be the side of Dr. King or George Wallace? Do you want to be the side of John Lewis or Bull Connor? Do you want to be the side of Abraham Lincoln or Jefferson Davis?” Biden asked. “This is the moment to decide, to defend our elections, to defend our democracy. If you do that you will not be alone.”
The President criticized states enacting restrictive voter laws, including Georgia. He said Georgia’s new election law was fueled by the “big lie” and “designed to suppress your vote and subvert our elections.”
Shortly before Biden’s speech, Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp alleged the Biden administration had lied about the state’s 2021 new voting law, claiming the legislation actually “makes it easy to vote and hard to cheat.” The voting law passed in Georgia does introduce new restrictions that tightened voting rules.
“Make no mistake, Georgia is ground zero for the Biden-Harris assault on election integrity,” Kemp said. “Ignoring facts and evidence, this administration has lied about Georgia’s Election Integrity Act from the very beginning, in an effort to force their unconstitutional, federal takeover of elections on the American people.”
Biden was joined on the trip to Georgia by Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he appointed to lead the administration’s work on voting rights.
In her remarks preceding the President in Atlanta, Harris took Republicans to task for obstructing voting rights legislation, saying they have “exploited” filibuster rules to block legislation.
“The Constitution of the United States gives the Congress the power to pass legislation,” Harris said. “And nowhere, nowhere, does the Constitution give a minority the right to unilaterally block legislation. The American people have waited long enough.”
Harris also asserted that Americans could face dire consequences if the nation becomes complacent about restrictive voter laws being enacted in various states, including Georgia.
“The assault on our freedom to vote will be felt by every American in every community in every political party. And if we stand idly by, our entire nation will pay the price for generations to come,” she said.
Several members of Congress, local officials and civil rights leaders accompanied Biden and Harris on different parts of the visit.
While in Atlanta, the President and vice president laid a wreath at the crypt of King and his wife, Coretta Scott King, and visited the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church.
Pressure from voting rights advocates
Biden’s visit to the Peach state, which takes places less than a week before MLK Jr. Day, comes amid pressure by advocates calling on Biden to spell out more clearly a pathway to the passage of the voting rights bills.
In a stinging statement following Biden’s speech, NAACP President Derrick Johnson said that “unless President Biden applies the same level of urgency around voting rights as he did for (Build Back Better) and infrastructure, America may soon be unrecognizable.”
“While President Biden delivered a stirring speech today, it’s time for this administration to match their words with actions, and for Congress to do their job. Voting rights should not simply be a priority — it must be THE priority,” Johnson added.
Rev. Al Sharpton, who met with Biden in Georgia after his speech, said in a statement that he told the President he “gave a monumental speech and, though I have been challenging him for months to be forthcoming, it was better late than never.”
“For Democrats to not stand up and support the sitting Democratic President will show that they have betrayed their party and the American people, and their legacies will be forever tainted,” Sharpton said.
A number of voting rights groups issued a letter saying Biden and Harris should not visit Atlanta without a concrete plan to pass voting rights bills into law immediately. On Monday, a coalition of voting rights groups in Georgia announced they will not be attending events surrounding Biden’s visit.
“We don’t need another speech. We don’t need him to come to Georgia and use us as a prop. What we need is work,” Cliff Albright, co-founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund, told CNN’s John Berman on “New Day” Tuesday morning.
Albright said he would like to see the President approach voting rights the same way he worked to get his bipartisan infrastructure law passed and personally appeal to senators.
“If he is saying the next seven days is going to be historic and critical, he’s got to fully lean in after he gives the speech, having the kinds of meetings, finding out from (West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe) Manchin what exactly it’s going to take, and being very direct and forceful – just as forceful as he has been on infrastructure and on some other issues,” Albright said.
Albright added: “There’s no sense in having 40 years of Senate experience only to tell us that you can’t whip two votes.”
Prominent Georgia leader Stacey Abrams – arguably the Democratic Party’s preeminent voting rights advocate after using her 2018 gubernatorial loss to Republican Brian Kemp to elevate the issue – did not attend Biden’s speech. After the election, Abrams founded Fair Fight, an organization that advocates for voter protection across the country, and she’s running for governor again this year.
The President said Tuesday morning that he had spoken with Abrams “at length,” attributing her absence at his forthcoming speech to a scheduling conflict. He said they maintain “a great relationship.”
“We’re all on the same page and everything’s fine,” he said.
Following Biden’s speech, Abrams released a statement lauding the President and vice president, saying they “made clear again today that they are committed to restoring the Senate to safeguard our democracy.”
Abrams also nodded to the voting rights activists who said they would not attend the event in protest because they wanted action, not speeches.
“Georgia activists have poured themselves into the fight to protect the freedom to vote nationwide while executing a fundamental expansion of power to a diverse electorate in our state. They have registered, engaged and inspired hundreds of thousands of Georgians, particularly voters of color, to exercise their electoral might, resulting in a political transformation of our state,” she said.
Jana Morgan, the director of Declaration for American Democracy, told CNN she is “cautiously optimistic” about Biden’s speech, but that she views it as a first step.
“We are going to be watching closely to make sure that there is follow up on these on these remarks,” Morgan said. She leads a coalition of organizations working to advance voting rights.
Morgan said she wants the President to be personally appealing to senators in order to get the voting rights legislation passed.
“He has said that this is the biggest test to our country since the Civil War, and I believe he’s right because American democracy is under attack. So, we wanted to see those strong words put into action,” Morgan said.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Tuesday en route to Georgia that Biden shares his own frustrations with voting rights activists over the impasse on voting rights.
“He shares the desire to get this done. He shares their frustration it’s not done yet,” Psaki said.

President Joe Biden's response to the Israel-Hamas war has sparked anger in a state that helped deliver him victory in 2020. Will there be a political cost?
Nadia Ayoub is desperately scrolling through social media, looking for 18-year-old Mohamed Raed Abu Hussain among images coming out of Gaza.
""I zoom into these horrible graphic pictures - I look to see is he in the background, is he somewhere? Are they searching for him? I'm just trying to find any clue that leads to him,"" she says.
Mohamed is instantly recognisable - he wears large black glasses and is missing a leg.
In 2018, he spent five months with Nadia and her husband Mike, in Dearborn, Michigan, to receive medical treatment. A local facility gave him a prosthetic leg.
""He's the cutest sweetest little kid,"" Mike says. ""I will always love him like a son.""
They kept in touch after he returned home to Gaza, and last week the Ayoubs - who are Lebanese Muslims - received a WhatsApp message in which he said he was heading to Jabalia refugee camp in the north of the territory.
""Don't worry about me,"" he wrote. And since then, nothing.
On a crisp autumn day, the couple joined dozens of people at an outdoor food truck market to fundraise for civilians in Gaza.
They are angry with President Joe Biden over his strong support for Israel's actions in Gaza in the aftermath of the attacks by Hamas on 7 October.
This has been made worse for them by the US vetoing a UN call for a ceasefire.
More on Israel-Gaza war
Hamas gunmen killed more than 1,400 people and took 241 hostages in the attack. Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which 10,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
""President Biden has blood on his hands,"" says Mike. ""He had my vote - he's lost it forever,"" Nadia adds.
It's a sentiment that's widespread across the city, where more than half the population is of Arab heritage. The local Arab American News newspaper is blunt, accompanying a picture of the president with the headline: ""He lost our votes.""
In a swing state like Michigan, the numbers will really matter in 2024.
Donald Trump won the state in 2016 by 10,000 votes. President Biden took it back from him by about 154,000 votes in 2020.
Given there are about 200,000 Muslim American voters in Michigan, to many it's clear that he needs their votes. But people in Dearborn feel betrayed, says local official Sam Baydoun.
""How can they vote for the president when they see these atrocities on live TV, and he is the one who is enabling this by sending more weapons?"" the county commissioner asks.

President Biden's staunch support of Israel is not new, but Mr Baydoun says he is surprised the president visited Tel Aviv during a war and met the Israeli cabinet.
A summit with Arab leaders in Jordan was cancelled after a strike on a hospital in Gaza.
""We need an immediate ceasefire. If the election was held today he would not get the Arab vote,"" Mr Baydoun says.
The Arab American Institute, an advocacy group, says that since the start of the conflict, support by Arab Americans for the Democratic Party has plummeted from 59% in 2020 to just 17%.
That would be the first time in nearly 30 years that the Democrats were not the party of choice for Arab American voters.
Mr Baydoun is a Democrat, and says the war has made his job tougher: ""How can I tell someone today to vote for President Biden?"" he asks.
The dilemma for many in Dearborn is that the alternative is Donald Trump - an unpopular choice given he signed an executive order when in office that briefly barred travellers and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries.
""I'm not going to tell people to vote for Trump. Obviously, I will not vote for Trump,"" the commissioner says.
Political analyst Larry Sabato says Mr Trump was in some ways a more pro-Israel president, infuriating Arab states by moving the capital to Jerusalem.
But that could mean Arab Americans stay at home, even if that benefits Mr Trump, Mr Sabato says.

Shoulder to shoulder - Biden and Netanyahu
New polling by Siena College for the New York Times suggests Mr Biden loses out to Mr Trump in swing states like Michigan on the question of who is more trusted to handle the Israel-Hamas conflict.
Nada Al-Hanooti's job is to turn out the Muslim American vote in Michigan, and he can sense a change in mood.
""I'm hearing friends, and colleagues from other institutions that they're either voting third party or they're staying home.""
Ms Al-Hanooti is executive director of Emgage, a civic engagement group that says it was instrumental in helping Mr Biden win Michigan in 2020.
""We made a lot of calls, sent a lot of text messages, did a lot of voter registration, as well as signing people up for absentee ballots. Biden needs the Muslim vote in order to win Michigan.""
Now she says she doesn't know what Emgage's strategy will be for 2024.
""The president's job is to be the moral compass of the nation. And right now he's lost trust and credibility with a lot of the American public.""
The election is about a year away - a lifetime in politics - will this feeling fade? ""We will not forget,"" Ms Al-Hanooti say. ""This is deep heartbreak.""
Israel has described the attack by Hamas as ""our 9/11"". Many in Dearborn who remember the World Trade Center attacks say the aftermath for Arabs reminds them of that time.
The fatal stabbing of a six-year old Palestinian boy in Illinois, days after the attack in Israel, has deepened that sense of unease. The boy's landlord is accused of attacking him and his mother because of their religion.
In recent days, President Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris have launched the country's first national strategy to counter Islamophobia.
Some in Dearborn have welcomed that but most want Biden to call for a ceasefire in Gaza - only then will he win back their support. For others, though, the damage is done no matter what he does.
In a local coffee shop, Lexi Zeidan - who is Palestinian Christian - says she's even stopped calling Mr Biden the president.
He had my vote in 2020 but no longer, she says. ""Why would I ever claim him to be a president - one that doesn't stand up for what's right, that doesn't stand up for a group of people that are defenceless.""

The White House has said a ceasefire would enable Hamas to regroup and instead they want a pause in Israeli bombardment to enable humanitarian aid to enter Gaza. This US stance is echoed by the UK, Canada and the European Union.
Larry Sabato says it's easy to dismiss the anger clearly evident in Dearborn as heat of the moment, but the Middle East goes to the heart of Arab Americans' priorities as it does for many Jewish Americans.
And while Mr Biden can't afford to lose Michigan, Mr Sabato points out that neither can he afford to lose the growing Jewish vote in other swing states like Arizona or Georgia.
Nearly 1.1 million Muslim voters cast ballots in the 2020 election, and according to Pew Research, there are about 5.8 million Jews in the US.
While data shows the Jewish vote is more diverse, with an increase in those voting for Republicans in 2020, polls suggest most back Democrats and are a base constituency for the party.
There isn't any definitive poll so far that tells us how Jewish American voters feel about Biden's handling of the Middle East war but Mr Sabato thinks it will matter.
""A Democrat really has to do well with Jewish Americans and Arab Americans in order to win,"" he says.",2023-11-06 17:27:36
